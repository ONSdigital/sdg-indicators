This means that we have to reformat data that is in a different format in order to make it usable on the site. We are looking to automate the process of updating the data we report. To do this we are working with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which allows two software applications to communicate. APIs are commonly used by websites across the internet to automate updates and changes.\n\nOur aim is to use APIs that will work with data published online on a different website. For example, the ONS Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per head time series has a supporting API which makes the data available in a format we can use.\n\nWe have written software program code to:\n-\tEnable our data site to link with APIs used by other websites reporting data\n-\tCalculate the relevant new figures\n-\tFormat the results so they are usable on our site\n-\tPrint our indicator files ready to go on our site\n\nWe are currently using APIs to update 15 different indicators. By automating these updates, we are able to report the latest data faster. To date we have concentrated on developing API communication with ONS websites. We are investigating which other websites we can connect to using APIs in the future.\n\nFor more information about the work we are doing with APIs, please contact us.\n","id":""},"/sdg-indicators/updates/2019/11/04/accessibility.html":{"type":"general.posts","url":"/sdg-indicators/updates/2019/11/04/accessibility.html","title":"Digital Accessibility Testing\n","content":"The commitment to “leave no one behind” is central to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It extends to making our digital content accessible and functional for all users regardless of any disability or physical impairment.\n\nOur SDG data site is still in a testing phase, so we are using the ‘alpha’ label. We want to move the site to the next phase known as ‘beta’. Before we can label the site as beta it has to reach the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) ‘AA’ standard, as well as other Government Digital Service criteria. This is a universally-recognised standard, designed to guarantee that assessed websites reach the predetermined accessibility criteria.\n\nWe updated some of the site’s features before it was tested, including:\n-\tmaking data tables and menus keyboard compatible\n-\timproving the high-contrast feature\n-\tadding descriptive labels and alternative text\n\nWe tested the improvements on a range of desktop and mobile devices using a variety of browsers and screen-readers.\nThe Digital Accessibility Centre tested the data site against the WCAG ‘AA’ standard in July 2019. The newly-accessible site was re-tested in July 2019 and passed, receiving ‘AA’ certification.\n\nWith ‘AA’ standard achieved, the UK SDG data site is now considered accessible to all users. A new code release (0.8.0) included these accessibility updates on the shared code repository ‘Open SDG’. This means that any country is able to use these updates.\n\nFor more information about what tools the site is compatible with and any know issues, see our accessibility statement, or please contact us.\n","id":""},"/sdg-indicators/updates/2019/11/04/funded-work.html":{"type":"general.posts","url":"/sdg-indicators/updates/2019/11/04/funded-work.html","title":"Funded work\n","content":"Our Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) project funds specific work across the Office for National Statistics (ONS). In this update those teams that receive SDG project funding explain the work they have been doing directly related to SDGs.\n\nONS Centre for Crime and Justice\nONS announced five centres focussing on key policy areas in 2018. Our [Centre for Crime and Justice] improves the understanding of the nature of crime.\n\nThis year, we reviewed all the ONS crime data used to report the SDG indicators. We have used the latest and the most appropriate data sources to update indicators as appropriate.\n\nA key focus for us has been investigating SDG indicators for which data is not provided. This includes indicators on modern slavery, human trafficking and child exploitation (Goal 16). We have made progress exploring new research methods and identifying potential data sources to support these indicators. We engaged with stakeholders from across government, academia and the third sector to help shape the research.\n\nONS Centre for Equalities and Inclusion\nOur Centre for Equalities and Inclusion was announced by ONS in 2018 too. We aim to work with others to ensure that the right data are available to address the main questions about fairness and equity in society.\n\nWe are working with the SDG team to develop the protected characteristics which align with the SDG disaggregations. New data sources and methods could benefit work programmes. They could also increase efforts for disadvantaged or discriminated groups.\n\nCentre for International Migration\nMigration is one of the main SDG disaggregations the United Nations requires countries to measure and report.\nThe Centre for International Migration has published a range of research outputs in the last year. The following research reports will provide input to SDG indicators. These reports give breakdowns by migratory status to provide evidence on the contribution that international migrants make to public services and the economy.\n\n\n  International migration and the education sector: This outlines the impact and contribution of international migration on the education sector at a local area. This will provide disaggregations for indicators within Goal 4: Quality Education.\n  International migration and the healthcare workforce: This draws on all available data on the migrant workforce in health care in the UK. This will provide a disaggregation for indicator 3.c.1; Health Worker density and distribution by migratory status.\n\n\nIn the coming year we will collaborate with colleagues across ONS to provide disaggregations for indicators related to birth rates and mortality using available data sources. We will also collaborate with colleagues from across the Government Statistical Service (GSS) to provide further disaggregations, specifically against Goal 4: Quality Education.\n\nTitchfield City Group on Ageing and Age-disaggregated data\nIn March 2018 the UN Statistics Committee endorsed the Titchfield City Group on Ageing and Age-disaggregated data. The main aim of our group is working with statistical organisations and others with a particular interest in ageing across the world to improve the measurement of ageing populations and older people. Age is one of the disaggregations required by the UN for measuring the SDGs. This is so that no one is left behind in progress towards the 2030 Agenda.\n\nWe discussed aligning our work to the SDGs at our second technical meeting in the Republic of Korea. The four objectives for this work strand are to:\n*\tassess the data available to monitor the “Leave No-one Behind” pledge\n*\tinterface with the IAEG on SDG indicators and to identify data needs to monitor the SDG framework for older people\n*\tcontribute to harmonisation and standards for producing ageing related data for disaggregation of SDG indicators\n*\tpilot innovative approaches to overcome challenges faced by NSOs in relation to availability and presentation of SDG data in relation to older people\n\nIn the past year we submitted a response to the Inter-Agency Expert Group (IAEG) for the SDGs 2020 indicator review. Over the coming year we will work on providing new age-related break downs of the SDG headline data for the UK.\n\nNatural Capital\nNatural Capital links economic and environmental data. We use the resulting statistics to estimate the value of the goods and services provided by nature in the UK. We also provide environmental statistical support to the ONS SDG Team.\n\nWe are developing statistics about where air temperature is cooled by trees and water. Our aim is to highlight inequalities between different geographical locations according to deprivation levels. This can inform sub-categories of headline environmental data reported about the SDGs in the UK.\n\nWe are supporting the improvement of data reported for SDG indicators about marine protection. For SDG target 14.7 (indicator 14.7.1) we are working on linking data about fish stock sustainability and the fishing economy.\n\nEnvironmental Accounts\nThe UK Environmental Accounts also link environmental and economic data. We have continued to help the ONS SDG team develop environmental related SDG indicators this year. We also highlighted the importance of SDG indicators within the UK Environmental Accounts in some publications.\n\nWe worked with the ONS SDG team to write our Greenhouse gas intensity, provisional estimates, UK: 2017 release. It highlighted SDG target 9.4 (indicator 9.4.1) about carbon dioxide emissions for which our data is used to report the UK SDG statistics.\n\nWe analysed the environmental impact of burning organic materials alongside its contribution to the UK’s renewable energy industry. Our article, A burning issue: biomass is the biggest source of renewable energy consumed in the UK highlighted SDG target 7.2 (indicator 7.2.1). We are working to provide sub-categories for UK SDG data about air emissions.\n\nWe worked with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the University of Leeds on Measuring material footprint in the UK: 2008 to 2016. The article presents updated estimates and discusses methodology for the UK’s material footprint. This work feeds into international decisions about the best methods for estimating material footprint. The data for the UK’s material footprint is used to report SDG targets 8.4 (indicator 8.4.1) and target 12.2 (indicator 12.2.1).\n\nGeospatial work in Data Architecture\nWe worked on a major cross-team project to produce data for how close people live to roads. The UK data is used to report SDG target 9.1 (indicator 9.1.1). Our project’s methodology can produce figures for every country in the world and was presented at the UN World Data Forum in Dubai. The project won the inaugural Government Science and Engineering Geography in Government Award. This work led to the World Bank reclassifying the indicator from Tier 3 to Tier 2. Tier 2 indicators have internationally established methodologies and standards available.\n\nWe are also sourcing data and analysing geographic data to tackle Goal 15 (indicators 15.1.1, 15.1.2 and 15.4.1.) Spatial disaggregation of forest area as a percentage of total land area (indicator 15.1.1) for the whole of UK is now available. This data is available at country and local authority level. It is available for years 2015 to 2017 for Great Britain and 2018 for Northern Ireland. Data showing the proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas (indicator 15.1.2) should follow shortly. We are also working on coverage by protected areas of important sites for biodiversity (indicator 15.4.1).\n\nWe carried out exploratory work on marine protected areas for SDG target 14.5 (indicator 14.5.1). We have also worked on national exclusive economic zones managed using ecosystem-based approaches for SDG target 14.2 (indicator 14.2.1).\n\nFor more information about the work we are doing with other departments, please contact us.\n","id":""},"/sdg-indicators/updates/2019/11/04/international-work.html":{"type":"general.posts","url":"/sdg-indicators/updates/2019/11/04/international-work.html","title":"International work\n","content":"The Department for International Development (DfID) has partnered with countries in Africa and Asia and we receive funding from DfID  to support these countries with their SDG reporting. Our aim is to help improve the quality and availability of SDG data for these overseas partners.\n\nThe Open SDG software that we have used to build our SDG data site was developed by ONS in partnership with the Centre for Open Data Enterprise (CODE) and the United States Government. The software is open source and free to use, making it potentially accessible to all countries looking to create a data site to report their SDG data.\n\nWe have worked with three countries to help them create and use their own country’s data site. Ghana was the first country to copy the UK SDG data site. We held a workshop to help our colleagues from the Ghana Statistical Service set up their site and explained how to convert existing Ghana data into SDG indicator statistics.\n\nWe repeated the process with our colleagues in National Statistics Institute Rwanda. We helped them create their own SDG data site, upload data and explained how to maintain the site. Their experience is given as a case study to help other countries set up their own data site.\n\nWe also worked with the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) to help the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic. Other countries can also learn from their experience in a case study.\n\nAny country can create their own version of the SDG data site using step-by-step online instructions. Over ten countries have copied the site without direct help, to date.\n\nSome countries choose to customise their site. For example, Kazakhstan has added visuals to their homepage. Armenia has added targets as well as indicators and reports national indicators.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals promote the idea of collaboration. With that in mind, it is important to make sure the SDG community shares new developments. Open SDG shares   software program code for additions, amendments and new features.It is a shared, open-source online GitHub resource. SDG community members can use the program code stored on the site to amend SDG data sites. The community encourages members to submit and review feature updates.\n\nCountries can copy the  Open SDG to create a new data site from scratch. The Open SDG releases incorporate any revised or new features. These include:\n-\tdata visualisations\n-\taccessibility improvements\n-\tlanguage translations\n-\treporting status categories\n\nOpen SDG has provided updates to available features following requests from community members. Recent new program code allows people to mark SDG indicators as ‘not applicable’, for example.\n\nWe are working with CODE and the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) to develop a way to use data and metadata in SDMX format. We have fixed various data visualisation bugs particularly in relation to maps. We also and added language translations in German, Spanish, French, Russian, Kazakh, Armenian and Arabic.\n\nFor more information about the international work we are doing, please contact us.\n","id":""},"/sdg-indicators/updates/2020/03/06/IWD-2020.html":{"type":"general.posts","url":"/sdg-indicators/updates/2020/03/06/IWD-2020.html","title":"Celebrating International Women’s Day 2020\n","content":"In celebration of International Women’s Day on Sunday (8th March), we have looked at what the UK SDG data says about the experience of women in the UK today.\n\n\n  The percentage of women in management positions in the UK increased between 2013 and 2017 and is highest in younger women. In 2017, 48% of 16 to 24-year olds in managerial positions were women. This is compared with 38% in the 45 to 54 age group.\n  In the last quarter of 2019, the percentage of young women who were not in education, employment or training in the UK was lower than men. The annual decrease of 43,000 in 2019 in the amount of young women in this situation, was the largest since July to September 2017 and the level reached a record low.\n  In the UK in 2019 the proportion of men who had recently used the internet was higher than women, although this difference has reduced since 2011. In 2019 this difference was driven by those in the oldest age groups. For example, 54% of men aged 75 and over were recent internet users, compared with 41% of women in this age group.\n  Female representation in the House of Commons has been increasing since 1997. The last official figures were reported before the 2019 general election. The House of Commons Library reported that a record 211 (32%) of MPs were women having risen from 27.8% in 1997. More female MPs (220) were elected in December 2019 but those figures have yet to be reported officially.\n  More girls than boys reach the learning standards expected for under 5 year olds in England (according to the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)). In 2018 77% of girls in England reached at least the “expected” level compared with 63% of boys.\n\n\nThe SDGs framework gives a picture of the UK across a broad range of issues in one place. We are looking to collect more data to go beyond the headline measures to show how the issues they cover effect different groups of the population. The Goals aim to “leave no one behind” and the ONS has committed to the Inclusive Data Charter which encourages an aim to break down headline data wherever possible, including by sex.\n\nAt ONS we are pulling together data from across Government and the country to do this.  Currently, the UK reports data for 77% of the 244 Sustainable Development Goals indicators.\n\nWe are working to find the best data and are experimenting to see where new statistics need to be created.

reporting\n","content":"In July 2021 we published a detailed outline of our approach to assessing the quality and suitability of statistics from non-official sources for SDG reporting. We produced a transparent protocol with a simple scoring system based on the pillars of the UKSA Code of Practice for Statistics and critical SDG characteristics. Putting this protocol in place was the result of collaborative work and feedback from across the GSS. It allows us to expand our breadth of sources beyond official statistics without compromising on quality. As a result, more vulnerable populations and environments could be highlighted as we fill outstanding headline and disaggregation gaps, making sure no-one and no-where is left behind.\n\nIn brief, the structure of the protocol includes an initial pass or fail gateway with the following essential criteria:\n\n\n  ethics and privacy\n  transparency and accountability\n  need\n\n\nIf the source passes on all of these elements, it proceeds to be scored on a scale of 0 (not acceptable) to 3 (high score) on the criteria:\n\n\n  relevance\n  methods\n  coverage\n  timeliness and ongoing availability\n  data quality\n\n\nA statistical output from a non-official source with an average score of over 1.5, and no scores of 0, is considered appropriate for SDG reporting. Using this system, we can see where strengths and weaknesses lie for each potential data source.\n\nThe scoring criteria listed above represent the latest version as of March 2022. This version differs slightly from the one published in the original publication from July 2021. We have refined the original scoring system following practical use within the SDG team, and dissemination at various conferences and workshops. The change affects the second stage of the scoring, where we have removed the original criteria of “data journey awareness” and “quality assurance”. Instead, we merged these into a single dimension called “data quality”. This change fits better with the details available for most non-official statistical sources. It still captures important and critical aspects of data quality, such as reliability, validity and quality assurance.\n\nUsing this protocol, we have assessed the non-official sources already used in SDG reporting, and confirmed they are fit for purpose. We also have plans to use further non-official sources to fill current gaps. For example, we are looking to fill sub-indicator headline gaps for indicator 6.6.1 using National River Flow Archive data. Another sub-indicator has already been filled with non-official statistics from the British Geological Survey. Also, headline gap for indicator 14.1.1 is soon going to be filled with non-official statistics based on Marine Conservation Society beach litter data.\n\nIn the original publication of the protocol, we emphasised that we would prioritise headline gaps, but we committed to outline a set of priorities for filling disaggregation gaps. Here we state that if we need to prioritise due to potential multiple non-official sources, this will be done based on disaggregations explicitly mentioned in the indicator’s title (we call these required disaggregations). For example, if the indicator has a required disaggregation by age or sex, we will prioritise non-official sources that help to fill those gaps. On the other hand, if a non-official source provides age or sex (or another disaggregation) for an indicator that does not explicitly require this breakdown in its title, the source will be classed as a lower priority. However, if we are in a position where resource is not an issue, we will aim to fill any available disaggregation or headline gap.\n\nThis protocol for assessment of non-official sources has gathered much interest internationally, and we have shared lessons learnt and appropriate resources with other National Statistical Institutes and through dissemination across various UN forums. This work continues to evolve, so we will update and refine in the future as necessary as we implement it.

This includes new data as well as updates to data we have already published. We will continue to collect data from existing sources where possible, in cooperation with topic experts.\n\nHow do I suggest new or different data sources?\nIf you have feedback on the data sources we have used or have suggestions for new data sources then please contact us\n\nWhat are you doing to fill data gaps?\nFor some indicators, although we may have data at the national level, our existing data sources don’t always allow us to disaggregate by all main groups.\n\nThis means we need to look for new data sources, link existing ones, or model data. We are working with colleagues across the Government Statistical Service to do this, including the Data Science Campus.\n\nWe had a consultation on measuring and reporting SDGs in the UK where we asked for your ideas on prioritising data development. Your feedback informed our data development plans.\n\nWhat does the reporting status mean?\nWe have used two different types of reporting status for an indicator, which are also colour coded:\n\n\n  \n    Reported online: As a minimum the headline national data for this indicator is available on this website but the data might not be fully disaggregated yet. We are continuing to source additional disaggregation’s\n  \n  \n    Exploring data sources: We are still looking for a suitable data source for this indicator\n  \n\n\nWhere there is additional information about the status of indicator data collection and reporting, this will be displayed at the top of the indicator page.\n\nWhat does the disaggregation status mean?\nMany Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicators require specific breakdowns, or disaggregations, below the headline figure.\n\nInitially our aim is to report the disaggregations which are listed within the title of the indicator. For example, indicator 8.5.2 specifies unemployment rate ‘…by sex, age and persons with disabilities’.\n\nWe show how much progress we have made on reporting these disaggregations on the ‘Disaggregation status’ tab of our Reporting Status page.\n\nThe different disaggregation statuses we use are:\n\n\n  \n    Fully disaggregated: All disaggregations specified in the indicator title are reported\n  \n  \n    Partially disaggregated: Some of the disaggregations specified in the indicator title are reported\n  \n  \n    Not disaggregated: None of the disaggregations specified in the indicator title are reported\n  \n  \n    Out of scope: Indicators where no disaggregation is specified in the indicator title\n  \n\n\nWhat disaggregations are available?\nWe report many other disaggregations beyond the ones that are required, regardless of any reference in the indicator title.\n\nFor details about all disaggregations, see the UK disaggregation report.\n\nWho uses this website?\nAn initial phase of user research has been carried out on the UK SDG data website. This research showed that the four main user types are:\n\n\n  \n    concerned citizen\n  \n  \n    connected influencer\n  \n  \n    fact gatherer\n  \n  \n    involved analyst\n  \n\n\nFor more information about these user personas and our user research, see our page which outlines the different user personas and their needs.\n\nCan other countries copy this website?\nYes. See the Open SDG Quick Start guide for technical instructions on the quickest way to get a copy of the Open SDG platform up and running.\n\nHow accessible is this website?\nOur aim is to make this website as accessible and usable as possible for every user. We have recently achieved the AA level standard of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1), with a Digital Accessibility Centre Certificate of Accreditation.\n\n\n\nFor details about compatibility with tools and known issues, please see our Accessibility statement.\n\nWhat browsers can I use to view this website?\nWe are developing and testing our site in line with the Government Digital Service (GDS) guidance on designing for different browsers and devices. Our website works with most of the latest versions of the commonly used browsers listed in the ‘Browsers to test in’ section of the GDS guidance.\n\nWhat do each of the three tiers mean?\nEach of the SDG indicators are assigned to one (or more) of the following tiers:\n - Tier 1: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, and data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant\n\n\n  \n    Tier 2: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but data are not regularly produced by countries\n  \n  \n    Tier 3: No internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for the indicator, but methodology/standards are being (or will be) developed or tested\n  \n\n\nFor more information, see the IAEG-SDGs Tier Classification for Global SDG Indicators\n\n\nFor further questions about the UK SDG data site please contact us\n\n\nBack to top\n","id":""},"/sdg-indicators/privacy-notice/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/sdg-indicators/privacy-notice/","title":"Privacy notice\n","content":"​\nThis privacy notice is for visitors to the UK Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) data website.\n​\n## What data we collect\n​\nWe collect information about how you use the UK SDG data website (sdgdata.gov.uk) to help us improve the website and make sure it is meeting the needs of its users.\n​\n\nWe collect information on:\n​\n- the pages you visit\n- how long you spend on each page\n- how you got to the website\n- what you click on while you are visiting the website\n- how you interact with a page\n- your Internet Protocol (IP) address\n- whether you have participated in a poll\n- questions, queries or feedback you leave (including your name, email address and phone number if you choose to provide it)\n​\n\nMore details about the information we collect is available in our Cookies policy.

They will often browse using handheld devices and may share links with others.\n\nWe must:\n\n\n  explain the SDGs in simple terms\n  give simple-to-understand context of what the goals mean\n  give them an overall view of UK performance against targets\n  explain what is being done to meet the targets\n  use visualisations to explain everything\n\n\nWe must not:\n\n\n  expect them to understand the data in the charts without any context\n  use terminology and technical terms\n  expect them to go into individual indicators to get a view of performance\n  put lots of methodology and usage notes in their way\n\n\nConnected influencer\n### Who they are\nSomeone non-statistical working in the not-for-profit space or for a private sector organisation looking to make money around sustainable development activities. Might be an individual attempting to challenge or guide on government policy.\n\nLikely to say\n“Give me a tool that will support my ambitions and give me a louder voice.”\n\nWhat motivates them\nConnected influencers understand the SDGs but don’t necessarily align to them. The SDGs provide a higher framework for them to align their work to.\n\nWhat they want\nConnected influencers want to:\n\n\n  use the SDG website to educate people\n  help businesses develop sustainability strategies\n  take content from the website and report on it\n  influence policies and change them\n  drive change\n  see how the UK and government are performing\n\n\nBehaviours and preferences\nThey have a good knowledge of the SDGs and use the SDGs to champion the themes they work in.

They cite the website in reports and may mix data from other sources.\n\nWe must:\n\n\n  provide them with a view of UK performance at every level\n  provide bite-sized summaries to brief them on progress\n  provide them with links to the physical source data\n  show them targets early in the journey\n  provide them with a quick view of what data has been collected, not collected and reasons why data was chosen or not collected\n\n\nWe must not:\n\n\n  expect them to find the source data with a generic link\n  populate the website with out-of-date information\n  hide facts and figures under complex levels of navigation\n\n\nInvolved analyst\n### Who they are\nInvolved analysts can be a range of different people, who usually work with international data:\n\n\n  A statistical audience working in or around the SDG framework\n  Users creating detailed reports as part of commissioned project work\n  Academia working in funded projects\n  Students researching set topics\n  Custodian agency analysts\n\n\nLikely to say\n“I just want the data so I can do my own thing with it.”\n\nWhat motivates them\nThey need somewhere to get some or all of the SDG data so they can answer questions for themselves or others.\n\nWhat they want\nInvolved analysts want to:\n\n\n  get data to take away and use\n  see trends behind the data\n  find outliers in the data such as ‘leave no one behind’\n  get all data or lots of data on given themes\n  mix data from other countries or sources\n\n\nBehaviours and preferences\nThey will often collaborate with others to produce analysis to inform or challenge policy and will share their reports with a wider audience. They will often copy the data directly from the tables rather than download it and will often transform the data for others.\n\nWe must:\n\n\n  give them advanced routes into the data from the outset\n  show them the targets\n  show relationships between different indicators\n  give them methodology behind the data\n  tell them if the data is comparable with other SDG data\n\n\nWe must not:\n\n\n  put lots of commentary and top-level visualisations in their way\n  make it hard to get lots of data\n  expect them to navigate each indicator to get the data they need\n  expect them to understand the difference between data on the UK NRP and the UN global database\n\n\nBack to top\n","id":""},"/sdg-indicators/goals/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/sdg-indicators/goals/","title":"UK data for the Sustainable Development Goals\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/sdg-indicators/reporting-status/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/sdg-indicators/reporting-status/","title":"Reporting Status\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/sdg-indicators/search/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/sdg-indicators/search/","title":"Search results\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/sdg-indicators/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/sdg-indicators/","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/sdg-indicators/indicators.json":{"type":"Pages","url":"/sdg-indicators/indicators.json","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/sdg-indicators/offline.html":{"type":"Pages","url":"/sdg-indicators/offline.html","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/sdg-indicators/manifest.json":{"type":"Pages","url":"/sdg-indicators/manifest.json","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/sdg-indicators/service-worker.js":{"type":"Pages","url":"/sdg-indicators/service-worker.js","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/sdg-indicators/6-b-1/":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/sdg-indicators/6-b-1/","title":"Indicator 6.b.1 - Proportion of local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management","content":"Non-statistical indicator\nThe supply of public drinking and sewerage services varies throughout the UK.

This series of questions is asked of the person in the household who knows the most about food purchasing and preparation.

The assessment concluded we were making progress towards the target but at an insufficient rate.\n\nThe report stated that - Invasive Non-Native Species (INNS) are managed on a Great Britain and all-Ireland basis in the British Isles, with countries working closely together to co-ordinate their efforts. Priority species have been identified following extensive scientific review and expert input and a framework to prioritise their management have been developed. Comprehensive risk analysis processes are in place (including horizon scanning, risk assessment and risk management), as are new information systems and contingency plans to support rapid response. Despite strong action, currently the number of INNS established in Britain has remained constant, in terrestrial environments, and has increased in the freshwater and marine environment.\n\nFurther information on the UK status against treaties and Action Plans, National Reports and National Legislation relating to invasive non-native species can be found on the InforMEA website.

These goals aim to (1) address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss, (2) reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and promote sustainable use, (3) improve the status of biodiversity, (4) enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity, (5) enhance implementation through participatory planning and knowledge management.\nThe United Kingdom (UK) agreed to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in 2010 and reported progress against these targets. In both the Sixth National Report to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (2019) and the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee’s report Biodiversity in the UK bloom or bust (2021), the UK was on track to achieving 5 of the 19 targets and failed to meet the other 14 targets. Specifically, the Sixth National Report to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (2019) indicates that the UK has achieved Target 2 of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.\nSubsequent to the ending of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in 2020, the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) have built these targets into delivering the 2020 biodiversity strategy (Biodiversity 2020 A strategy for England’s wildlife and ecosystem services).\nThe devolved administrations of the UK have established a range of country-based initiatives to support the achievement of Aichi Target 2. In England, the \nNational Planning Policy Framework was amended to strengthen the protection for irreplaceable habitats outlining that planning policies and decisions should contribute to and enhance the natural environment. This protection is being expanded nationally in November 2023 with the introduction of Defra’s Biodiversity Net Gain strategy for developers. In Scotland, a natural capital asset index has been published annually since 2011, measuring the quality and quantity of habitats according to their potential to deliver ecosystem services now and in the future. \nWales has introduced the Well-being of Future Generations Act 2015 which brings biodiversity into the central decision-making process for public sector bodies in Wales.\nBeyond 2020, the UK has committed to further protection under the 30 by 30 commitment, which aims to protect 30% of land and seas by 2030 with a view to boosting biodiversity.\nThe Aichi Biodiversity Targets came to an end in 2020 and have since been replaced by the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) was agreed at the 2022 United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP 15). It is formed of 23 targets for 2030 and four longer-term goals for 2050 to reach the vision of living in harmony with \nnature by 2050.\nThe four countries of the UK are committed to working together to implement the GBF. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) are responsible for facilitating the cross-UK work necessary for developing the UK’s response to the GBF to meet the UK’s international commitment to update our national biodiversity strategies and action plans to align with the GBF. JNCC expect to publish the UK’s response to the GBF in advance of COP 16, which will enable the UK to be factored into global analysis of information in the national biodiversity strategies and action plans. Subsequently, the UK will report progress in achieving national targets against the GBF in the Seventh National Report to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in 2026, following on from the Sixth National Report to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity \n(2019) which reported against the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.\nAt present (September 2023), England has published their national biodiversity strategy (Environmental Improvement Plan, 2023) and Scotland has recently published a significant consultation on their Strategic Delivery Framework for Biodiversity.\nSub-indicator b\nThe UK implements the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA) in the Environmental Accounts and Natural Capital Accounts published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The \nmethodology behind the implementation of SEEA in the UK’s Natural Capital Accounts can be found in the ONS publication Principles of UK natural capital accounting (2023).\nThe Environmental Accounts show how the environment contributes to+B23 the economy (for example, through the extraction of raw materials), the impacts that the economy has on the environment (for example, energy consumption and air pollution emissions), and how society responds to environmental issues (for example, through taxation and expenditure on environmental protection).\nUK Natural Capital comprises all the ecosystem services that UK natural assets provide; natural assets include soil, air, water, and all living things. The Natural Capital Accounts include both monetary estimates of ecosystem and other service flows, and habitat accounts. The habitat accounts provide estimates of the extent, condition, and asset values of different ecosystem types.\n","id":"15.9.1","indicator_available":"(a) Relevant UK policies and strategies relating to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets; and (b) relevant national account publications implementing Systems of Environmental-Economic Accounting.\n","graph_title":"(a) Number of countries that have established national targets in accordance with or similar to Aichi Biodiversity Target 2 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 in their national biodiversity strategy and action plans and the progress reported towards these targets; and (b) integration of biodiversity into national accounting and reporting systems, defined as implementation of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting\n","data_keywords":"Non-statistical, legislation, policy, biodiversity, Aichi, accounts, environment, natural capital\n"},"/sdg-indicators/6-3-1/":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/sdg-indicators/6-3-1/","title":"Indicator 6.3.1 - Proportion of domestic and industrial wastewater flows safely treated","content":"We have not yet found any suitable data sources for this indicator.\nIf you have any data source suggestions, please contact us.\n","id":"6.3.1","indicator_available":"\n","graph_title":"\n","data_keywords":"\n"},"/sdg-indicators/1/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/1/","title":"Goal 1 - End poverty in all its forms everywhere","content":"","id":"1"},"/sdg-indicators/2/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/2/","title":"Goal 2 - End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture","content":"","id":"2"},"/sdg-indicators/3/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/3/","title":"Goal 3 - Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages","content":"","id":"3"},"/sdg-indicators/4/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/4/","title":"Goal 4 - Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all","content":"","id":"4"},"/sdg-indicators/5/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/5/","title":"Goal 5 - Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls","content":"","id":"5"},"/sdg-indicators/6/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/6/","title":"Goal 6 - Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all","content":"","id":"6"},"/sdg-indicators/7/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/7/","title":"Goal 7 - Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all","content":"","id":"7"},"/sdg-indicators/8/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/8/","title":"Goal 8 - Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all","content":"","id":"8"},"/sdg-indicators/9/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/9/","title":"Goal 9 - Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation","content":"","id":"9"},"/sdg-indicators/10/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/10/","title":"Goal 10 - Reduce inequality within and among countries","content":"","id":"10"},"/sdg-indicators/11/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/11/","title":"Goal 11 - Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable","content":"","id":"11"},"/sdg-indicators/12/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/12/","title":"Goal 12 - Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns","content":"","id":"12"},"/sdg-indicators/13/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/13/","title":"Goal 13 - Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts","content":"","id":"13"},"/sdg-indicators/14/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/14/","title":"Goal 14 - Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development","content":"","id":"14"},"/sdg-indicators/15/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/15/","title":"Goal 15 - Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss","content":"","id":"15"},"/sdg-indicators/16/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/16/","title":"Goal 16 - Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels","content":"","id":"16"},"/sdg-indicators/17/":{"type":"Goals","url":"/sdg-indicators/17/","title":"Goal 17 - Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development","content":"","id":"17"}};
