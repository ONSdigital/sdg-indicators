For insight into the details of potential calculations please refer to the original source metadata or source contact. A basic summary of the concept  behind the formation of the indicator is as follows:  The number of neonatal deaths divided by the number of births in the same time period and this will be multiplied by 1,000 to get a rate that gives a figure per thousand births.

            Neonatal death is the death of a child of when the age of the child is under 28 days. Early neonatal death is under the age of 7 days, late neonatal is between 7 and 27 days, postnatal is between 28 days and 1 year and infant death is classified as under 1 year.
Socio-economic status is defined as the social status of a person based on their occupation, income and education.
Type of registration refers to the address status of the parents, and shows whether they are living together or separately.
