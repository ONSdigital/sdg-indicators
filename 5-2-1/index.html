            Presently the only ages covered are between 16 and 59 but the upper bound of this is likely to increase over time. The original figures refer to data that runs from April of that year to March the following year. For example 2015 data date range is from April 2015 to March 2016.  These data relate to women aged 16 and over (as opposed to 15 and over)  The headline data are published in July, however the specific breakdowns (disaggregation’s, i.e. age,  etc) are published in February.  Coverage is limited to England and Wales.

            No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator. For insight into the details of potential calculations please refer to the original source metadata or source contact. A basic summary of the concept  behind the formation of the indicator is as follows:  Taking the total number of women aged 16 to 59 in England and Wales who experienced any abuse by a partner or ex-partner in the past 12 months and divided this by the total number of women with the same age category in England/Wales and multiplied by 100.
