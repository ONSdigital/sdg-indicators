  The OECD Frascati Manual provides the relevant definitions for research and experimental development, gross domestic expenditure on R&D and researchers. Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications. Intramural expenditures are all expenditures for R&D performed within a statistical unit or sector of the economy during a specific period, whatever the source of funds. Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems and also in the management of the projects concerned. GDP at chained volume measure is a series of GDP statistics adjusted for the effect of inflation to give a measure of ‘real GDP’. Chained volume GDP statistics are calculated by measuring output using the price level of the preceding year and then linking the statistics to give a reflection of actual output changes and excluding any monetary (inflationary) change.
