      Reporting status provides an overview of how much Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) data the UK reports. For more information, see [What does the reporting status mean?](https://onsdigital.github.io/sdg-indicators/faq/#what-does-the-reporting-status-mean)

      Disaggregation status provides an overview of how many of the SDG indicators are disaggregated. For more information, see [What does the disaggregation status mean?](https://onsdigital.github.io/sdg-indicators/faq/#what-does-the-disaggregation-status-mean)

      For details about all available disaggregations and how each indicator is disaggregated, see the [UK disaggregation report](https://onsdigital.github.io/sdg-data/disaggregations.html).

      Note: These percentages have been rounded. As a result, adding them together may not equal exactly 100%.
