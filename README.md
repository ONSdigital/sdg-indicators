This is a development website for collecting and disseminating UK data for the Sustainable Development Goal global indicators. This is a collaboration between the [ONS Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/programmesandprojects/sustainabledevelopmentgoals) team and the [ONS Data Science Campus](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/datasciencecampus), building on the earlier work of the [US GSA](https://github.com/GSA/sdg-indicators). 

For any guidance on how to use the website or develop it further for your own country, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-indicators/wiki). Please send any comments and feedback to <a href ="mailto:sustainabledevelopment@ons.gov.uk">sustainabledevelopment@ons.gov.uk</a>.
