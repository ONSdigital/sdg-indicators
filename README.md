This is a development website for collecting and disseminating UK data for the Sustainable Development Goal global indicators. This is a collaboration between the [ONS Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/programmesandprojects/sustainabledevelopmentgoals) team and the [ONS Data Science Campus](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/datasciencecampushttps://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/datasciencecampushttps://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/datasciencecampushttps://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/datasciencecampushttps://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/datasciencecampus), building on the earlier work of the [US GSA](https://github.com/GSA/sdg-indicators). Currently data on the site may be test data.

For any guidance on how to use the website or develop it further for your own country, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/sdg-indicators/wiki).
