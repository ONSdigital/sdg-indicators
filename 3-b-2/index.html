            Figures may not sum due to rounding.   In the CRS (Creditor Reporting System), data on the sector of destination are recorded using 5-digit purpose codes.  The first three digits of the code refer to the corresponding DAC5 sector or category.  Each CRS code belongs to one and only one DAC5 category.  Generally, the last two digits of the CRS purpose code are sequential and not hierarchical i.e., each CRS code stands for itself and can be selected individually or grouped to create sub-sectors. The Governance and civil society, general sector is an exception where purpose codes are hierarchically structured.   It is not possible to track directly the destination or purpose of UK funding to the general core budgets of the multilateral organisations. However a good indication of where UK funding goes is provided by OECD DAC data where the multilaterals report aid spend by country and sector. Therefore the multilateral data are estimates which have been calculated on the basis of the UK's share of the multilaterals' reported aid spending to the OECD.  The OECD data cover most of the main multilaterals the UK funds.  About 15% of the UK's core multilateral funding is not covered by the OECD data, and this unreported spending is allocated to the developing countries unspecified category.   More details on the estimates' quality are found in the Imputed multilateral share quality report (Statistics on International Development 2016).

            Bilateral Aid: Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid: This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations. Purpose Codes: The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. The sector classification codes used can be found on the OECD website (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm).
