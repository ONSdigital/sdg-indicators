# You will need to change all of the Github-related variables below according
# to your Github setup. For example, if your site and data repositories are:
# -- https://github.com/my-awesome-github-org/my-awesome-site-repo
# -- https://github.com/my-awesome-github-org/my-awesome-data-repo
# Then you would want to make these replacements throughout this file:
# -- replace "my-github-org" with "my-awesome-github-org"
# -- replace "open-sdg-site-starter" with "my-awesome-site-repo"
# -- replace "open-sdg-data-starter" with "my-awesome-data-repo"
#
# NOTE: This "production" version only contains differences from site_config_prod.yml.
#
# Whereas site_config.yml can be produced using the site configuration
# form, we recommend you manually edit this file directly.
#
# See also _config_prod.yml in the root of this repository.
