## Cookies that measure website use (analytics cookies)

We use Google Analytics and Hotjar to collect information about how you use the website. We use this data to help make the website better.

Google Analytics and Hotjar set cookies that store anonymised information about:

* how you got to the website

* what you click on while you’re visiting the website
* the way you use a page (for example, what you concentrate on and where you click and scroll)

We do not allow Google or Hotjar to use or share the information about how you use this website.
