## Creating a copy of this website
Open SDG is a reporting platform developed for managing and publishing data and statistics related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is built exclusively with open-source libraries and tools and can be hosted and maintained using free services. Though the platform itself is available at no cost, it can be modified to fit a variety of user needs, and comes with many customizable tools and features. All of these features make the Open SDG platform a low-cost, high-feature option for SDG reporting.

Other countries wishing to reuse the Open SDG reporting platform are welcome to do so for free. The [Open SDG Quick Start guide](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start/) gives technical instructions on the quickest way to get a copy of the Open SDG platform up and running.

We hope this documentation is helpful for getting your Open SDG project started. Please reach out to us on the [Open SDG GitHub](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg) if you have comments, feedback, or want to get involved with the Open SDG community.
