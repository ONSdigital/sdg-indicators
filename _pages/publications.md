As well as collecting and reporting UK data for the global Sustainable Development Goals indicators, ONS will be releasing various publications putting the numbers into context. We will make these publications available on this page.

Between July and September, we ran a public consultation asking for feedback on our approach to reporting and prioritising data development for SDGs. We plan to publish our response to the consultation in December, which will include details of our plans for future reporting.

If you have any feedback on our publications please contact us at <a href="mailto:sustainabledevelopment@ons.gov.uk">sustainabledevelopment@ons.gov.uk</a>

### Goal 3

* **[UK drops in European child mortality rankings, 13 October 2017](https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-drops-in-european-child-mortality-rankings/)**  
This short story looks at the two indicators (under five and neonatal mortality) under Target 3.2, showing that although the UK has seen improvements over the last forty years, the rate of improvement has slowed compared with some other EU countries.
