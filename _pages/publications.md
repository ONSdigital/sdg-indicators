As well as collecting and reporting UK data for the global Sustainable Development Goals indicators, ONS will be releasing various publications putting the numbers into context. We will make these publications available on this page.

Between July and September, we ran a public consultation asking for feedback on our approach to reporting and prioritising data development for SDGs. We plan to publish our response to the consultation in December, which will include details of our plans for future reporting.

If you have any feedback on our publications please contact us at <a href="mailto:sustainabledevelopment@ons.gov.uk">sustainabledevelopment@ons.gov.uk</a>

## Publications

### All goals

* **Sustainable Development Goals: progress and possibilities - publishes 9 November 2017**
This is our first report on the progress we’ve made towards measuring the global Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators in the UK. It looks at the work we have been doing to be able to measure our progress and explains how we are already sharing the data we have.

### Goal 3

* **[UK drops in European child mortality rankings, 13 October 2017](https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-drops-in-european-child-mortality-rankings/)**  
This short story looks at the two indicators (under five and neonatal mortality) under Target 3.2, showing that although the UK has seen improvements over the last forty years, the rate of improvement has slowed compared with some other EU countries.
