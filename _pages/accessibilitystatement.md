This accessibility statement applies to the Office for National Statitics (ONS) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) website.

This website is run by the ONS. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

*	change colours, contrast levels and fonts
*	zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
*	navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
*	navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
*	listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA, ZoomText, TalkBack and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## Compliance status

This website is fully compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) [AA standard](https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/index.php/ons-sustainable-development-goals).

## How accessible this website is
Even though this website is AA compliant, we are aware of some issues at a higher compliance level:

*	Assistive technology can’t read charts or maps on the site so please use the data table view instead
*	If you are using Internet Explorer, you won’t be able to sort or filter data tables with keyboard navigation so please download the data files to sort and filter data
