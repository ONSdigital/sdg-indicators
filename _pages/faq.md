## How often will new data be added to this site?
We will add data as soon as it has been sourced and checked. This includes new data as well as updates to data we have already published. We will continue to collect data from existing sources where possible, in cooperation with topic experts.

## What are you doing to fill data gaps?
For some indicators, although we may have data at the national level, our existing data sources don’t always allow us to disaggregate by all main groups.

This means we need to look for new data sources, link existing ones, or model data. We are working with colleagues across the Government Statistical Service to do this, including the Data Science Campus.

We published [our response to the consultation on measuring and reporting SDGs in the UK](https://consultations.ons.gov.uk/sustainable-development-goals/ons-approach-to-measuring-reporting-sdgs-in-the-uk/) where we asked for your ideas on prioritising data development. Your feedback informed our [data development plans](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/ukdatagapsinclusivedataactionplantowardstheglobalsustainabledevelopmentgoalindicators/2018-03-19).

## Can other countries copy this website?
Yes. [See the Open SDG Quick Start guide](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start/) for technical instructions on the quickest way to get a copy of the Open SDG platform up and running.

## What does the reporting status mean?
We have used three different types of reporting status for an indicator, which are also colour coded:

* Reported online (green) – as a minimum the headline national data for this indicator is available on this website but the data might not be fully disaggregated yet. We are continuing to source additional disaggregations.
* Exploring data sources (red) – we are still looking for a suitable data source for this indicator.

Where there is additional information about the status of indicator data collection and reporting, this will be displayed at the top of the indicator page.

## What do each of the three tiers mean? 
Each of the SDG indicators are assigned one (or more) of the following tiers:
- Tier 1: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, and data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant.
- Tier 2: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but data are not regularly produced by countries.
- Tier 3: No internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for the indicator, but methodology/standards are being (or will be) developed or tested.

For more information, [see the IAEG-SDGs Tier Classification for Global SDG Indicators](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/tier-classification/)

## How accessible is this website?

![DAC logo with two ticks indicating AA certification](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/public/dac_logo_with_two_ticks.png)

Our aim is to make this website as accessible and usable as possible for every user. We have recently achieved the AA level standard of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag), with a [Digital Accessibility Centre Certificate of Accreditation](http://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/index.php/office-for-national-statistics-sdg).

For details about compatibility with tools and known issues, please see our [Accessibility statement]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/accessibilitystatement.md %}).

## What browsers can I use to view this website?
We are developing and testing our site in line with the [Government Digital Service (GDS) guidance on designing for different browsers and devices](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices). Our website works with most of the latest versions of the commonly used browsers listed in the ‘Browsers to test in’ section of the GDS guidance. There are some known issues with using the site on older versions of browsers e.g. IE8 *and we are working to fix these.* - _**do we want to get rid of this? Similarly to accessibility statement, we don't want to say we're trying to fix these if not.**_
