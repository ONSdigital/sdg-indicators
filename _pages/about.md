The [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) (SDGs) are a universal call to action to:

  * end poverty
  
  * protect the planet
  
  * improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere

The 17 Goals were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015, as part of the [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda).

## ONS' role in the SDGs
The [Office For National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) (ONS) is the UK’s largest independent producer of official statistics and its recognised National Statistical Institute (NSI).

In this role, we are coordinating and reporting on the global SDG indicators for the UK. This fulfils the mandate placed on all countries by the United Nations General Assembly.

As one of the world leaders in providing data for the SDG indicators our aims include: 

  * supporting colleagues across the world develop capability
  
  * collaborating and coordinating with topic leads across the Government Statistical Service and beyond
  
  * reporting UK SDG data
  
  * shining a light on who is being ‘left behind’ - so policy makers can take action 
  
  * promoting the SDG-related work we do
  
Cabinet Office and the Department for International Development (DfID) have responsibility for policy implementation. 

## About this site
