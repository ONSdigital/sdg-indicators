The [Sustainable Development Goals](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDGs) are a set of ambitious goals and targets designed to make the world a better place by ending poverty, halting climate change and reducing inequalities. This work programme is part of the country’s commitment to the agenda 2030 on sustainable development. 

ONS are fulfilling the mandate placed on all NSIs by the UN General Assembly to coordinate and report on the global SDG indicators. We aim to shine a light on who is being ‘left behind’ so policy makers can take action, and we aim to support colleagues across the world develop capability. Cabinet Office and DfID have responsibility for policy implementation. Our role is to collaborate and coordinate with topic leads across the GSS and beyond, use innovative techniques to report data and to promote the SDG-related work we do. *We are one of the world leaders in providing data to monitor progress.* - do we want to say this?? Maybe better to link to progress report? 

The site is based on the open source [Open SDG](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) platform. The Open SDG platform is the result of collaboaration between the US government, the UK [Office For National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) (ONS), and the nonprofit [Center For Open Data Enterprise](http://opendataenterprise.org/) (CODE).

## Open SDG

Open SDG is a reporting platform developed for managing and publishing data and statistics related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is built exclusively with open-source libraries and tools and can be hosted and maintained using free services. Though the platform itself is available at no cost, it can be modified to fit a variety of user needs, and comes with many customizable tools and features including:

- Data that can be downloaded in machine-readable formats
- Several options for data visualizations: graphs, data tables, and maps
- Data management capabilities and tools that can display the percentage of indicators with statistics that are being reported online, statistics that are in progress, and statistics that are currently being explored for each goal
- Availability in all official UN languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, and Spanish. Additional languages are currently being added through SDG Translations

All of these features make the Open SDG platform a low-cost, high-feature option for SDG reporting. We hope this documentation is helpful for getting your Open SDG project started. Please reach out to us on GitHub if you have comments, feedback, or want to get involved with the Open SDG community.

Other countries wishing to reuse the Open SDG reporting platform are welcome to do so for free. The Open SDG [Quickstart guide](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start/) gives technical instructions on the quickest way to get a copy of the Open SDG platform up and running. Note that this site is currently at an Alpha stage, and so is still under development.
