The [Sustainable Development Goals](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDGs) are a set of ambitious goals and targets designed to make the world a better place by ending poverty, halting climate change and reducing inequalities. This work programme is part of the country’s commitment to the agenda 2030 on sustainable development.

### ONS' role in the SDGs
ONS are fulfilling the mandate placed on all NSIs by the UN General Assembly to coordinate and report on the global SDG indicators. We aim to shine a light on who is being ‘left behind’ so policy makers can take action, and we aim to support colleagues across the world develop capability.

Cabinet Office and the Department for International Development (DfID) have responsibility for policy implementation. Our role is to collaborate and coordinate with topic leads across the GSS and beyond,  to report data and to promote the SDG-related work we do. We are one of the world leaders in providing data for the SDG indicators.
