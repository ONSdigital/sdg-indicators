            It is important to note that national minimum training requirements can vary widely from one country to the next. This variability between countries lessens the usefulness of global tracking because the indicator would only show the percent reaching national standards, not whether teachers in different countries have similar levels of training. Further work would be required if a common standard for teacher training is to be applied across countries.

The indicator should be calculated separately for public and private institutions. From OECD: Teachers (ISCED 2 level) were asked to indicate whether they had participated in any of the following activities 12 months prior to the survey: 	Courses/workshops (on subject matter or methods and/or other education-related topics). 	Education conferences or seminars (where teachers and/or researchers present their research results and discuss education problems). 	Observation visits to other schools. 	Observation visits to business premises, public organisations, or non-governmental organisations. 	In-service training courses in business premises, public organisations or non-governmental organisations. 	Qualification programmes (e.g. a degree programme). 	Participation in a network of teachers formed specifically for the professional development of teachers. 	Individual or collaborative research on a topic of professional interest. 	Mentoring and/or peer observation and coaching as part of a formal school arrangement
