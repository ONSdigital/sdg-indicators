A basic summary of the concept  behind the formation of the indicator is as follows:  In order to calculate the percentage of people who are current cigarette smokers aged 16 years and older; divide the number of cigarette smokers, aged 16 years and older, by the total population, aged 16 years and older, and multiply the output figure by 100.
