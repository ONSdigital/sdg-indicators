            Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the value of goods and services produced in a given time period. Real GDP takes the value of goods and services produced in the UK, but it takes into account changing prices to remove the effect of rising prices over time, otherwise known as inflation. Per capita shows the GDP per person, GDP per person shows the amount of resources available to people in the country.
Manufacturing value added (MVA) is the total value of goods and services net of intermediate consumption.
