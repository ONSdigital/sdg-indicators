            Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the value of goods and services produced in a given time period. Real GDP takes the value of goods and services produced in the UK, but it takes into account changing prices to remove the effect of rising prices over time, otherwise known as inflation. Per capita shows the GDP per person, GDP per person shows the amount of resources available to people in the country.
Manufacturing value added (MVA) is the total value of goods and services net of intermediate consumption.

            Manufacturing value added (MVA) is the total value of goods and services net of intermediate consumption. It is generally compiled as the sum of the value added of all manufacturing activity units in operation in the reference period. It can be presented in percentage to gross domestic product (GDP) as well as per capita for any reference year. MVA growth rates are given at constant prices.
