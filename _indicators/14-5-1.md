  The indicator is computed by dividing the total number of KBAs wholly covered
  by protected areas by the total number of KBAs in each country, and
  multiplying by 100. 'Wholly protected' is defined as >98% coverage to allow
  for resolution and digitisation errors in the underlying spatial datasets.
indicator_definition: "Definition The percentage of marine sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity that are wholly covered by designated protected areas. It is a thematic disaggregation of the multi-purpose indicator for protected area coverage of important sites. Concepts Protected areas, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), are clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. Importantly, a variety of specific management objectives are recognised within this definition, spanning conservation, restoration, and sustainable use: \tCategory Ia: Strict nature reserve \tCategory Ib: Wilderness area \tCategory II: National park \tCategory III: Natural monument or feature \tCategory IV: Habitat/species management area \tCategory V: Protected landscape/seascape \tCategory VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources The status \"designated\" is attributed to a protected area when the corresponding authority, according to national legislation or common practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially endorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the purpose of biodiversity conservation, not de facto protection arising because of some other activity (e.g., military). Sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity are identified following globally standard criteria applied at national levels. Two variants of these standard criteria have been applied in all countries to date. The first is for the identification of Important Bird & Biodiversity Areas (IBAs), that is, sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, identified using data on birds, of which >12,000 sites in total have been identified from all of the world's countries. The second is for the identification of Alliance for Zero Extinction sites (AZEs), that is, sites holding effectively the entire population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In total, 587 AZE sites have been identified for 920 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, conifers, and reef-building corals. A global standard for the identification of key biodiversity areas (KBAs) unifying these approaches along with other mechanisms for identification of important sites for other species and ecosystems is in the final stages of development and anticipated to be in place by the end of 2015. Marine sites are defined as those identified for marine species or ecosystems, as documented in the IUCN Red List Habitats Classification Scheme."

  By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent
  with national and international law and based on the best available scientific
  information.

  The safeguard of important sites is vital for stemming the decline in
  biodiversity. The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism
  for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring
  progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of marine
  ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international
  agreements. Importantly, it is not restricted to any single marine ecosystem
  type, and so faithfully reflects the intent of SDG target 14.2. 

  Levels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management
  categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their
  natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or
  tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. 

  In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have become places of
  high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; protecting
  watersheds from erosion; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources;
  supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science,
  research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other
  non-material values. 

  This indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from
  traditionally reported simple statistics of territorial area covered by
  protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a
  country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100.
  Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme
  variation of biodiversity importance over space, and so risk generating
  perverse outcomes through the protection of areas which are large at the
  expense of those which require protection.
