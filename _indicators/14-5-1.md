indicator_definition: "Definition The percentage of marine sites contributing significantly
  to the global persistence of biodiversity that are wholly covered by designated
  protected areas. It is a thematic disaggregation of the multi-purpose indicator
  for protected area coverage of important sites. Concepts Protected areas, as defined
  by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), are clearly defined
  geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective
  means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem
  services and cultural values. Importantly, a variety of specific management objectives
  are recognised within this definition, spanning conservation, restoration, and sustainable
  use: \tCategory Ia: Strict nature reserve \tCategory Ib: Wilderness area \tCategory
  II: National park \tCategory III: Natural monument or feature \tCategory IV: Habitat/species
  management area \tCategory V: Protected landscape/seascape \tCategory VI: Protected
  area with sustainable use of natural resources The status \"designated\" is attributed
  to a protected area when the corresponding authority, according to national legislation
  or common practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially
  endorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the purpose
  of biodiversity conservation, not de facto protection arising because of some other
  activity (e.g., military). Sites contributing significantly to the global persistence
  of biodiversity are identified following globally standard criteria applied at national
  levels. Two variants of these standard criteria have been applied in all countries
  to date. The first is for the identification of Important Bird & Biodiversity Areas
  (IBAs), that is, sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity,
  identified using data on birds, of which >12,000 sites in total have been identified
  from all of the world's countries. The second is for the identification of Alliance
  for Zero Extinction sites (AZEs), that is, sites holding effectively the entire
  population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered
  on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In total, 587 AZE sites have been identified
  for 920 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, conifers, and reef-building
  corals. A global standard for the identification of key biodiversity areas (KBAs)
  unifying these approaches along with other mechanisms for identification of important
  sites for other species and ecosystems is in the final stages of development and
  anticipated to be in place by the end of 2015. Marine sites are defined as those
  identified for marine species or ecosystems, as documented in the IUCN Red List
  Habitats Classification Scheme."
target: By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent
  with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.
