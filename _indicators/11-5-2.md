indicator_name: Direct disaster economic loss in relation to global GDP, including
  disaster damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services
target: By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people
  affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global
  gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with
  a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations.
indicator_definition: "Direct economic loss: Direct loss is nearly equivalent to physical
  damage. The monetary value of total or partial destruction of physical assets existing
  in the affected area. Examples include loss to physical assets such as damaged housings,
  factories and infrastructure. Direct losses usually happen during the event or within
  the first few hours after the event and are often assessed soon after the event
  to estimate recovery cost and claim insurance payments. These are tangible and relatively
  easy to measure. Direct Economic loss in this indicator framework consists of agriculture
  loss, damage to industrial and commercial facilities, damage to housings and critical
  infrastructures. \tWe limit the economic loss into direct economic loss, excluding
  indirect loss (e.g. loss due to interrupted production) and macro-economic loss.
  The reason is that there is not yet universally standardized methodology to measure
  indirect and macro-economic loss while direct loss data monitoring is relatively
  simpler and more standardized. Global gross domestic product: Summation of GDP of
  Countries. GDP definition according to the World Bank. Hazardous event: The occurrence
  of a natural or human-induced phenomenon in a particular place during a particular
  period of time due to the existence of a hazard. Hazard: A potentially damaging
  physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or
  injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation.
  UNISDR recommends setting NO threshold for recording hazardous event in order to
  monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are
  not registered in international disaster loss databases account for an important
  share of damages and losses when they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the
  national and international community. These events, when accumulated, are often
  a source of poverty in developing countries but can be effectively addressed by
  well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction
  2015-2030 is \"the risk of small-scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent,
  sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by natural or man-made hazards as well as
  relate environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks\". Regarding
  the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards in natural hazards category
  and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR will discuss the issue
  with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would be in a better position
  in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member States and other stakeholders
  to monitor biological events including epidemics. However, we generally do not expect
  biological disasters will cause physical damages to facilities. ). \tNote: Terminology
  will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group
  for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction."
