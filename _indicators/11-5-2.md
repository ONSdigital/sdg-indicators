  Cities around the world, as well as rural populations, witness growing
  disaster risks. Impacts of climate change on sustainable development are
  observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing
  temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts,
  salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and
  desertification) and extreme weather events. The economic loss indicator would
  track loss to agricultural, industrial and commercial sectors and damage to
  housing and critical infrastructure. 

  Cities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned
  urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate
  infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and
  hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas
  are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones.
  SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal
  flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due
  to undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined
  with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate
  capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to unsustainable
  coping strategies and mechanisms. 

  Large numbers of people remain perilously close to falling into poverty,
  experiencing shocks that they are unable to cope with. For the poor, a shock
  of even a relatively short duration can have long term consequences. Several
  dimensions of poverty are closely related to environment, which is often
  affected by natural disasters. The poverty reduction agenda could include
  well-designed social protection scheme to help protecting the poor against
  sudden shocks and the development of capacities to better predict and prepare
  for such shocks. Better management of natural resources can themselves
  strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of
  natural hazardous events and offering resources to help cope with them. 

  The environment for food production is increasingly challenging, particularly
  for smallholders, due to environmental and climate-related factors. Similar to
  extreme income poverty, food insecurity continues to be predominantly
  concentrated in rural areas of developing countries, and disproportionately
  affects poor farmers, agricultural workers, pastoralists and rural
  communities. Common conditions for protracted crisis situations include
  frequent or continued exposure to shocks that undermine livelihoods, food and
  market systems. Special consideration needs to be given to population living
  in areas prone to environmental and natural disaster shocks. 

  Biodiversity provides ecosystem resilience and contributes to the ability to
  respond to unpredictable global changes and natural disasters. Healthy
  ecosystems act as buffers against natural hazards, providing valuable yet
  underutilized approaches for climate change adaptation, enhancing natural
  resilience and reducing the vulnerability of people, for example to floods and
  the effects of land degradation. These ecosystem services improve the
  sustainability and economic efficiency of built infrastructure, and are
  critical for sustainable and resilient urban areas. 

  This indicator will track direct physical loss expressed in economic term. The
  disaster loss data (particularly mortality) are significantly influenced by
  large-scale catastrophic event, which represent important outliers. UNISDR
  recommends countries to report the data by event, so complementary analysis
  can be done by both including and excluding such catastrophic events. 

  The indicator will build bridge between SDGs and the Sendai Framework for
  Disaster Risk Reduction because the reduction of direct economic loss is
  included in the Sendai Framework global targets and will also be monitored
  under the Sendai Framework Monitoring Mechanism.

  Direct disaster economic loss in relation to global GDP, including disaster
  damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services
target: >-
  By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people
  affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to
  global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related
  disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable
  situations.
indicator_definition: "Direct economic loss: Direct loss is nearly equivalent to physical damage. The monetary value of total or partial destruction of physical assets existing in the affected area. Examples include loss to physical assets such as damaged housings, factories and infrastructure. Direct losses usually happen during the event or within the first few hours after the event and are often assessed soon after the event to estimate recovery cost and claim insurance payments. These are tangible and relatively easy to measure. Direct Economic loss in this indicator framework consists of agriculture loss, damage to industrial and commercial facilities, damage to housings and critical infrastructures. \tWe limit the economic loss into direct economic loss, excluding indirect loss (e.g. loss due to interrupted production) and macro-economic loss. The reason is that there is not yet universally standardized methodology to measure indirect and macro-economic loss while direct loss data monitoring is relatively simpler and more standardized. Global gross domestic product: Summation of GDP of Countries. GDP definition according to the World Bank. Hazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence of a hazard. Hazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. UNISDR recommends setting NO threshold for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community. These events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is \"the risk of small-scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks\". Regarding the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events including epidemics. However, we generally do not expect biological disasters will cause physical damages to facilities. ). \tNote: Terminology will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction."
method_of_computation: >-
  The original national disaster loss databases usually register physical damage
  value (housing unit loss, infrastructure loss etc.). Need conversion from
  physical value to monetary value according to the UNISDR methodology. After
  converted, divide global direct economic loss by global GDP (inflation
  adjusted, constant USD) calculated from World Bank Development Indicators.
