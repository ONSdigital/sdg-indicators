indicator_name: Direct economic loss in relation to global GDP, damage to critical
  infrastructure and number of disruptions to basic services, attributed to disasters
target: By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people
  affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global
  gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with
  a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations
indicator_definition: "Direct economic loss: Direct loss is nearly equivalent to physical\
  \ damage. The monetary value of total or partial destruction of physical assets\
  \ existing in the affected area. Examples include loss to physical assets such as\
  \ damaged housings, factories and infrastructure. Direct losses usually happen during\
  \ the event or within the first few hours after the event and are often assessed\
  \ soon after the event to estimate recovery cost and claim insurance payments. These\
  \ are tangible and relatively easy to measure. Direct Economic loss in this indicator\
  \ framework consists of agriculture loss, damage to industrial and commercial facilities,\
  \ damage to housings and critical infrastructures. \tWe limit the economic loss\
  \ into direct economic loss, excluding indirect loss (e.g. loss due to interrupted\
  \ production) and macro-economic loss. The reason is that there is not yet universally\
  \ standardized methodology to measure indirect and macro-economic loss while direct\
  \ loss data monitoring is relatively simpler and more standardized. Global gross\
  \ domestic product: Summation of GDP of Countries. GDP definition according to the\
  \ World Bank. Hazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon\
  \ in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence\
  \ of a hazard. Hazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human\
  \ activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and\
  \ economic disruption or environmental degradation. UNISDR recommends setting NO\
  \ threshold for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events.\
  \ Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international\
  \ disaster loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when\
  \ they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community.\
  \ These events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries\
  \ but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai\
  \ Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is \"the risk of small-scale and\
  \ large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused\
  \ by natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological\
  \ and biological hazards and risks\". Regarding the inclusion of biological and\
  \ environmental hazards in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate\
  \ man-made hazards, UNISDR will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations\
  \ (for example, WHO would be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and\
  \ relationship with Member States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events\
  \ including epidemics. However, we generally do not expect biological disasters\
  \ will cause physical damages to facilities. ). \tNote: Terminology will be discussed\
  \ and finalized in the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework\
  \ for Disaster Risk Reduction."
