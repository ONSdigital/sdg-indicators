indicator_name: Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality
target: By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping
  and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion
  of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.
indicator_definition: 'Proportion of water bodies (area) in a country with good ambient
  water quality compared to all water bodies in the country. ''Good'' indicates an
  ambient water quality that does not damage ecosystem function and human health according
  to core ambient water quality indicators. Concept: Water quality is estimated based
  on a core set of five determinands that inform on major water quality impairments
  present in many parts of the world: total dissolved solids (TDS); percentage dissolved
  oxygen (% DO); dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN); dissolved inorganic phosphorus
  (DIP); and Escherichia coli (E. coli). As monitoring capacities and coverage vary
  between countries, a monitoring ladder is proposed. On the first rung, the number
  of determinands not meeting national water quality guidelines based on the existing
  monitoring sites are used to estimate the water quality. On the second rung, a water
  quality index is used to combine the determinand values in a statistically more
  robust manner, and the monitoring coverage increased. On consecutive rungs, the
  monitoring coverage can be step-wise increased and complementary determinands covering
  additional aspects of ambient water quality can be included depending on the national
  capacities and requirements enabling the indicator to inform on the status of ambient
  water quality in a more comprehensive way.'
