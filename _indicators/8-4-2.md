  DMC reports the amount of materials that are used that are used in a national
  economy. DMC is a territorial (production side) indicator. DMC also presents
  the amount of material that needs to be handled within an economy, which is
  either added to material stocks of buildings and transport infrastructure or
  used to fuel the economy as material throughput. DMC describes the physical
  dimension of economic processes and interactions. It can also be interpreted
  as long_term waste equivalent. Per_capita DMC describes the average level of
  material use in an economy ' an environmental pressure indicator'_'and is also
  referred to as metabolic profile.

target: >-
  Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption
  and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental
  degradation, in accordance with the 10-year framework of programmes on
  sustainable consumption and production, with developed countries taking the
  lead.
indicator_definition: >-
  Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow accounting
  (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent consumption of materials in a
  national economy. It is calculated as direct imports (IM) of material plus
  domestic extraction (DE) of materials minus direct exports (EX) of materials
  measured in metric tonnes. DMC measures the amount of materials that are used
  in economic processes. It does not include materials that are mobilized the
  process of domestic extraction but do not enter the economic process. DMC is
  based on official economic statistics and it requires some modelling to adapt
  the source data to the methodological requirements of the MFA. The accounting
  standard and accounting methods are set out in the EUROSTAT guidebooks for MFA
  accounts in the latest edition of 2013. MFA accounting is also part of the
  central framework of the System of integrated Environmental_ Economic Accounts
  (SEEA).
