computation_units: Percentage (%)
computation_definitions: >-
  Woodland certification assesses management practices against agreed environmental standards. Certification requires that wood products are harvested legally and sustainably, and that important wildlife habitats are identified and are not negatively impacted by management.
computation_calculations: >-
  (Area of woodland / Area of land mass ) * 100 OR (area of certified woodland / Area of land mass ) * 100




computation_disaggregation: Geography 

comments_limitations: >-
  · The  UN identifies a forrest as  “land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ".  The definition used in th UK calculations only counts areas where the canopy covers more than 20%.
  · Certification in the UK began in 1996, with data collation starting in 2001, becoming a regular annual collation in 2004.  New certificates may relate to existing woodland that was not previously certified, or to newly planted areas.
