indicator_name: Forest area as a proportion of total land area
target: By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial
  and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands,
  mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.
indicator_definition: "The indicator is already included among the indicators for
  the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) (indicator 7.1 \"Proportion of land covered
  by forest\") . In order to provide a precise definition of the indicator, it is
  crucial to provide a definition of \"Forest\" and \"Total Land Area\". According
  to the FAO definitions, Forest is defined as \"land spanning more than 0.5 hectares
  with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees
  able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly
  under agricultural or urban land use\". More specifically: \tForest is determined
  both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The
  trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters. \tIt includes areas
  with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy
  cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes
  areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management
  practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5
  years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame
  is used. \tIt includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest
  in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific
  environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest. \tIt includes
  windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares
  and width of more than 20 meters. \tIt includes abandoned shifting cultivation land
  with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover
  of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters. \tIt includes areas
  with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land
  area or not. \tIt includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations.
  \tIt includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy
  cover criteria are met. \tIt excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems,
  such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry
  systems when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry systems such
  as the \"Taungya\" system where crops are grown only during the first years of the
  forest rotation should be classified as forest. Total land area is the total surface
  area of a country less the area covered by inland waters, like major rivers and
  lakes."
