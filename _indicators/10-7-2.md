rationale_interpretation: 'With target 10.7 the OWG has acknowledged the significance of well-managed migration policies for the quality of migration ("orderly, safe, regular and responsible:") which in turn determines development outcomes of migration. This would ensure that migrants are not left behind. Bearing in mind that "well-managed migration policies:" is a multi-dimensional issue, spanning issues like migrant remittances, circular migration, responses to climate change and crises; a composite index would be the only way to capture progress and to make actionable gap analyses. The monitoring of the commitment to "well-managed migration policies:" through a composite index would enable to bring together the already existing broad range of sources on migration policy such as follow-up mechanisms of international conventions and protocols related to international migration as well as elements captured in the outcome documents from the deliberations in the 2nd and 3rd Committees of the General Assembly, the High-level Dialogues on International Migration and Development, the Commission on Population and Development, the Human Rights Council, the Global Forum on Migration and Development and IOM Council.'

method_of_computation: "The International Migration Policy Index would track development and identify gaps through aggregation of reporting on migration policies relevant for the SDG framework. The aggregation of constituent items of \"well-managed migration policies\" will be based on existing regional and thematic migration policy indexes and state of the art methodology on conceptualizing and measuring migration policies (Bjerre et. al 2015). Current work points toward the index tracking status regarding the following migration policy strands: \tPromoting and protecting the human rights of migrants \tSupporting socio-economic outcome \tSupporting regulated mobility \tMobility dimensions of crisis \tPartnerships and cooperation Computation would be based on a three-tier-scale, e.g. 100 = comprehensive; 50 = elaborated; 0 = basic level of implementation; or 100 = 100%-90%; 50 = 89%-40%; 0 = 39% and below for proportion of coverage etc."
