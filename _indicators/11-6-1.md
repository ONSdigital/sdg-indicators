indicator_name: Proportion of urban solid waste regularly collected and with adequate
  final discharge out of total urban solid waste generated, by cities
target: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including
  by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management.
indicator_definition: The recycling rate is the tonnage recycled from municipal waste
  divided by the total municipal waste arising. Recycling includes material recycling,
  composting and anaerobic digestion. Municipal waste consists to a large extent of
  waste generated by households, but may also include similar wastes generated by
  small businesses and public institutions and collected by the municipality; this
  latter part of municipal waste may vary from municipality to municipality and from
  country to country, depending on the local waste management system (Eurostat, 2013)
