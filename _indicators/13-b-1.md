  As the effects of climate change are becoming more evident and acute, the need
  for effective climate services is greater than ever before. Climate services
  underpin climate action and achieving SDGs. Nevertheless, the GFCS High level
  Task Force had identified 70 countries that do not yet have sufficient
  capacities to develop and use climate services. This is a major focus of the
  GFCS. This indicator contributes and supports the achievement of several
  targets such as 1.5, 2.1, 6.1, 6.4, 6.5, 7.1, 9.1, 11.3, 11.5, 12.8, 13.1,
  13.2, 14.2, 15.3.

  The United States is not an LDC or a SIDS, although we prioritize support for
  these countries in the provision of climate related support.
