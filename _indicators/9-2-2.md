indicator_definition: 'From ILO:  This indicator is computed as the number of persons
  employed in the industry sector divided by total employment. Employed persons are
  defined as all those of working age who, during a short reference period, were engaged
  in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. The industry
  sector comprises mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction and public utilities
  (electricity, gas and water).  From UNIDO:  Employment is defined as a work performed
  for pay or profit. The value is obtained by summing up the number of employed in
  all manufacturing activities. The manufacturing employment indicator is presented
  in absolute terms as well as relative to total employment.'
