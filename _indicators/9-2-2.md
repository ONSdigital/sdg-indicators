  Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030,
  significantly raise industry's share of employment and gross domestic product,
  in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed
  countries
indicator_definition: >-
  From ILO:  This indicator is computed as the number of persons employed in the
  industry sector divided by total employment. Employed persons are defined as
  all those of working age who, during a short reference period, were engaged in
  any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. The
  industry sector comprises mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction
  and public utilities (electricity, gas and water).  From UNIDO:  Employment is
  defined as a work performed for pay or profit. The value is obtained by
  summing up the number of employed in all manufacturing activities. The
  manufacturing employment indicator is presented in absolute terms as well as
  relative to total employment.

  To calculate manufacturing employment as a percentage of total employment the
  figures for manufacturing employment divided by total employment for the same
  period and then this figure was multiplied by 100.   The annual figures were
  calculated by summing the employment figures for each quarter and then
  dividing this figure by 4. This calculation was used for employment in the
  manufacturing sector and the total employment figures and then the annual
  percentage was calculated.
computation_numerator: Number of people employed in the manufacturing sector × 100

  The employed are defined as those aged 16 or over, who are in employment if
  they did at least one hour of work in the reference week (as an employee, as
  self-employed, as unpaid workers in a family business, or as participants in
  government-supported training schemes), and those who had a job that they were
  temporarily away from (for example, if they are on holiday).
