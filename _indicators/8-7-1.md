indicator_name: Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in child
  labour, by sex and age
target: Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern
  slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the
  worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and
  by 2025 end child labour in all its forms.
indicator_definition: "From ILO: The term child labour reflects the engagement of
  children in prohibited work and, more generally, in types of work to be eliminated
  as socially and morally undesirable as guided by national legislation, the ILO Minimum
  Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138), and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention,
  1999 (No. 182), their respective supplementing Recommendations (Nos 146 and 190),
  and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The statistical measurement
  framework for child labour is structured around (i) the age of the child; (ii) the
  productive activities by the child, including their nature and the conditions under
  which these are performed, and the duration of engagement by the child in such activities.
  For the purpose of statistical measurement, children engaged in child labour include
  all persons aged 5 to 17 years who, during a specified time period, were engaged
  in one or more of the following categories of activities: \t(a) worst forms of child
  labour, (as described in paragraphs 17'30, 18th ICLS resolution); \t(b) employment
  below the minimum age, (as described in paragraphs 32 and 33 of the 18th ICLS resolution);
  and \t(c) hazardous unpaid household services, (as described in paragraphs 36 and
  37 of the 18th ICLS resolution), applicable where the general production boundary
  is used as the measurement framework.  From UNICEF:  This indicator provides the
  proportion of children aged 5-17 years who are engaged in child labour. It is calculated
  by dividing the number of children aged 5-17 years who are reported to have been
  engaged in child labour in the past week by the total number of children aged 5-17
  in the population."
