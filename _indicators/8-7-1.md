rationale_interpretation: "From ILO: \nTo monitor the progress against the target 8.7. Indicator is straightforward to interpret, as it gives the headcount of child labourers at national, regional and global levels. \n\n From UNICEF: \n Children around the world are routinely engaged in paid and unpaid forms of work that are not harmful to them. However, children are considered to be involved in child labour when they are either too young to work or are involved in activities harmful to their health and development. Children's involvement in hazardous work can compromise their physical, mental, social and educational development. \nThe issue of child labour is guided by three main international conventions: ILO Convention No. 138 concerning minimum age for admission to employment and Recommendation No. 146 (1973); ILO Convention No. 182 concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour and Recommendation No. 190 (1999); and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (Article 32), including its Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. These conventions frame the concept of child labour and form the basis for child labour legislation enacted by countries that are signatories. \nAs per the 2008 Resolution concerning Statistics of Child Labour, the operation definition of child labour is based on number of hours spent working and working conditions, and encompasses both engagement in economic activities as well as household chores."

indicator_name: 'Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in child labour, by sex and age'
target: 'Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms.'
indicator_definition: "From ILO: The term child labour reflects the engagement of children in prohibited work and, more generally, in types of work to be eliminated as socially and morally undesirable as guided by national legislation, the ILO Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138), and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182), their respective supplementing Recommendations (Nos 146 and 190), and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The statistical measurement framework for child labour is structured around (i) the age of the child; (ii) the productive activities by the child, including their nature and the conditions under which these are performed, and the duration of engagement by the child in such activities. For the purpose of statistical measurement, children engaged in child labour include all persons aged 5 to 17 years who, during a specified time period, were engaged in one or more of the following categories of activities: \t(a) worst forms of child labour, (as described in paragraphs 17'30, 18th ICLS resolution); \t(b) employment below the minimum age, (as described in paragraphs 32 and 33 of the 18th ICLS resolution); and \t(c) hazardous unpaid household services, (as described in paragraphs 36 and 37 of the 18th ICLS resolution), applicable where the general production boundary is used as the measurement framework.  From UNICEF:  This indicator provides the proportion of children aged 5-17 years who are engaged in child labour. It is calculated by dividing the number of children aged 5-17 years who are reported to have been engaged in child labour in the past week by the total number of children aged 5-17 in the population."
