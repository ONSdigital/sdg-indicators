rationale_interpretation: 'PSE Indicators show what share of support to agriculture can be considered to be highly production and trade distorting (as opposed to be only minimally influencing markets through more decoupled measures of support). The OECD Producer Support Estimate (PSE) indicators were developed in order to monitor and evaluate developments in agricultural policy, to establish a common base for policy dialogue among countries, and to provide economic data to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of policies. The indicators were mandated by OECD Ministers in 1987, and have since been calculated for OECD and an increasing number of non-OECD countries, and are widely referred to in the public domain. Domestic support notifications to the WTO are an obvious source for an indicator on target 2b as well; however, notifications often have a significant time lag and not all countries notify.'

target: 'Correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect, in accordance with the mandate of the Doha Development Round.'
indicator_definition: 'The Percentage Producer Support Estimate (%PSE) represents policy transfers to agricultural producers, measured at the farm gate and expressed as a share of gross farm receipts. Transfers included in the PSE are composed of market price support, budgetary payments and the cost of revenue foregone by the government and other economic agents.'
