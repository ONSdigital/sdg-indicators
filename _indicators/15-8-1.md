indicator_name: Proportion of countries adopting relevant national legislation and
  adequately resourcing the prevention or control of invasive alien species
target: By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly
  reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control
  or eradicate the priority species
indicator_definition: This indicator measures the management response globally, by
  tracking invasive alien species legislation for control and prevention at national
  and international levels. The more countries with Invasive Alien Species (IAS) and
  Biosecurity related legislation, the greater the global commitment to controlling
  the threat to biodiversity from IAS. The larger the number of IAS-relevant international
  policies, and the greater the level of national commitment to these, the greater
  the global commitment to controlling IAS. The more international agreements a country
  is party to the more strongly committed the country is to controlling IAS.
