rationale_interpretation: "The projection of the current trend of adoption of national policies on invasive alien species projects a nonsignificant increase by 2020, with a slowing of the rate of increase in the proportion of countries adopting such legislation. The adoption of national and international policies on invasive alien species may be a first step to combatting the spread of invasive alien species. \nStrengths \n\tThis indicator covers 191 countries worldwide. Caveats \n\tThe adoption of legislation does not necessarily indicate the existence of regulations or policy to implement the legislation or how successful such implementation has been on the ground There still remains a need for further indicator development to make this link clearer. \n\tLegislation does not necessarily capture all efforts against invasive alien species that are happening at the national level. \nCurrent storyline \n55% of countries that are Party to the CBD have overarching national legislation to prevent, control and/or limit the spread and impact of invasive alien species. \n\n see report for related information \n Adoption of national legislation relevant to the prevention or control of invasive alien species. Source: McGeoch et al. (2010) Global indicators of alien species invasion: threats, biodiversity impacts and responses. Diversity and Distributions, 16, 95-108. \nThis indicator measures the adoption of national legislation relevant to the prevention or control of invasive alien species. The global trend in policy response has been positive for the few last decades and, since the publication of GBO3, the adoption of policies against invasive alien species has significantly increased. \nAs reported in 2010, 55% of the countries signatories to the CBD have enacted invasive alien species relevant national legislation, and most CBD parties were signatory to at least one of ten other multilateral agreements that cover IAS in some form. Among these countries 8% are signatory to all 10 international agreements (McGeoch et al. 2010). For example, the Council of Europe has been developing and adopting codes of conduct addressing some key pathways (e.g. horticulture, botanic gardens, zoos, hunting, or fishing) of invasive alien species. Moreover, once the European regulation on invasive alien species is fully adopted, it will have major implications for neighbouring countries, but also at a world scale, as the European institution is a major partner for global trade. \nProducing this indicator nationally... \nAll countries (191 in 2010) party to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) were included in this calculation. Ten multinational environment related agreements were used to quantify trends in the adoption of IAS related policy. National legislation related to the prevention, management and control of IAS was recorded including year of enactment, type of legislation (prevention, management etc.) and the data analysed to calculate the indicator. \nUse at the national level... \nAs reported in 2010, 55% of the countries signatories to the CBD have enacted invasive alien species relevant national legislation, and most CBD parties were signatory to at least one of ten other multilateral agreements that cover IAS in some form.

Plans are to update this baseline, enhance it and make it available for global, regional and national use."

indicator_name: 'Proportion of countries adopting relevant national legislation and adequately resourcing the prevention or control of invasive alien species'
target: 'By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.'
indicator_definition: 'This indicator measures the management response globally, by tracking invasive alien species legislation for control and prevention at national and international levels. The more countries with Invasive Alien Species (IAS) and Biosecurity related legislation, the greater the global commitment to controlling the threat to biodiversity from IAS. The larger the number of IAS-relevant international policies, and the greater the level of national commitment to these, the greater the global commitment to controlling IAS. The more international agreements a country is party to the more strongly committed the country is to controlling IAS.'

method_of_computation: 'Data for this indicator were produced as follows: any national legislation relevant to controlling invasive alien species was identified for each of the 191 Parties to the CBD. Legislation was considered relevant to the prevention of alien species introductions or to control of invasive alien species if it applied to multiple taxonomic groups and was not exclusively intended to protect agriculture. If two separate sets of legislation within a country covered plants and animals, the date of the more recent legislation was used.'
