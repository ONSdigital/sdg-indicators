indicator_name: Total net official development assistance to medical research and
  basic health sectors
target: Support the research and development of vaccines and medicines for the communicable
  and non‑communicable diseases that primarily affect developing countries, provide
  access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines, in accordance with the Doha
  Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, which affirms the right of
  developing countries to use to the full the provisions in the Agreement on Trade-Related
  Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights regarding flexibilities to protect public
  health, and, in particular, provide access to medicines for all
indicator_definition: Total ODA flows to developing countries quantify the public
  effort that donors provide to developing countries for medical research and basic
  health.

computation_definitions: 'Bilateral Aid: Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by
  donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral
  aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where
  the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds
  will be spent on. Multilateral Aid: This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions
  to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations. Purpose Codes: The
  DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists
  which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In
  addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. The
  sector classification codes used can be found on the OECD website (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm).'
computation_calculations: The raw data underlying the United Kingdom Statistics on
  International Development was summed around appropriate aid description CRS codes,
  bilateral and multilateral classification, donor recipient countries, and type of
  aid codes.   The codes used to measure net ODA to the medical research and basic
  health sectors were those that sit under DAC 5 CODE’s 121 and 122 which are the
  purpose codes for the medical research and health sectors.
computation_numerator: Net Overseas Development Aid to the medical research and basic
  health sectors (£ 000’s)
computation_denominator: 'Not applicable '
computation_disaggregation: This data can be disaggregated by Flow of Aid (Bilateral/Multilateral)
  and Aid Category/Description (DAC 5/CRS Code). Flow of Aid (Bilateral/Multilateral)
  can be disaggregated by other disaggregation.
comments_limitations: Figures may not sum due to rounding.   In the CRS (Creditor
  Reporting System), data on the sector of destination are recorded using 5-digit
  purpose codes.  The first three digits of the code refer to the corresponding DAC5
  sector or category.  Each CRS code belongs to one and only one DAC5 category.  Generally,
  the last two digits of the CRS purpose code are sequential and not hierarchical
  i.e., each CRS code stands for itself and can be selected individually or grouped
  to create sub-sectors. The Governance and civil society, general sector is an exception
  where purpose codes are hierarchically structured.   It is not possible to track
  directly the destination or purpose of UK funding to the general core budgets of
  the multilateral organisations. However a good indication of where UK funding goes
  is provided by OECD DAC data where the multilaterals report aid spend by country
  and sector. Therefore the multilateral data are estimates which have been calculated
  on the basis of the UK's share of the multilaterals' reported aid spending to the
  OECD.  The OECD data cover most of the main multilaterals the UK funds.  About 15%
  of the UK's core multilateral funding is not covered by the OECD data, and this
  unreported spending is allocated to the developing countries unspecified category.   More
  details on the estimates' quality are found in the Imputed multilateral share quality
  report (Statistics on International Development 2016).
