  ODA is the accepted measure of international development co-operation.
  Separate data are available on aid to medical research for the benefit of
  developing countries and on aid in support of basic health interventions, but
  the total of the two most closely matches the target.

  Support the research and development of vaccines and medicines for the
  communicable and non-communicable diseases that primarily affect developing
  countries, provide access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines, in
  accordance with the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health,
  which affirms the right of developing countries to use to the full the
  provisions in the Agreement on TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property
  Rights regarding flexibilities to protect public health, and, in particular,
  provide access to medicines for all.

  Bilateral Aid: Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when
  the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes
  aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the
  government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds
  will be spent on.

  Multilateral Aid: This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to
  organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations.

  Purpose Codes: The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat
  maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid
  flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify
  information in the DAC databases. The sector classification codes used can be
  found on the OECD website
  (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm).
computation_calculations: >-
  The raw data underlying the United Kingdom Statistics on International
  Development was summed around appropriate aid description CRS codes, bilateral
  and multilateral classification, donor recipient countries, and type of aid
  codes.   The codes used to measure net ODA to the medical research and basic
  health sectors were those that sit under DAC 5 CODE’s 121 and 122 which are
  the purpose codes for the medical research and health sectors.

  Net Overseas Development Aid to the medical research and basic health sectors
  (£ 000’s)
computation_denominator: 'Not applicable '
computation_disaggregation: >-
  This data can be disaggregated by Flow of Aid (Bilateral/Multilateral) and Aid
  Category/Description (DAC 5/CRS Code). Flow of Aid (Bilateral/Multilateral)
  can be disaggregated by other disaggregation.
comments_limitations: >-
  Figures may not sum due to rounding.   In the CRS (Creditor Reporting System),
  data on the sector of destination are recorded using 5-digit purpose codes. 
  The first three digits of the code refer to the corresponding DAC5 sector or
  category.  Each CRS code belongs to one and only one DAC5 category. 
  Generally, the last two digits of the CRS purpose code are sequential and not
  hierarchical i.e., each CRS code stands for itself and can be selected
  individually or grouped to create sub-sectors. The Governance and civil
  society, general sector is an exception where purpose codes are hierarchically
  structured.   It is not possible to track directly the destination or purpose
  of UK funding to the general core budgets of the multilateral organisations.
  However a good indication of where UK funding goes is provided by OECD DAC
  data where the multilaterals report aid spend by country and sector. Therefore
  the multilateral data are estimates which have been calculated on the basis of
  the UK's share of the multilaterals' reported aid spending to the OECD.  The
  OECD data cover most of the main multilaterals the UK funds.  About 15% of the
  UK's core multilateral funding is not covered by the OECD data, and this
  unreported spending is allocated to the developing countries unspecified
  category.   More details on the estimates' quality are found in the Imputed
  multilateral share quality report (Statistics on International Development
  2016).
