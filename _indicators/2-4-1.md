indicator_name: Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture
target: By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient
  agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain
  ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather,
  drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil
  quality.
indicator_definition: 'The denominator, agricultural area, is a well-known and established
  indicator that are collected by statistical bodies in countries and compiled internationally
  via a questionnaire by FAO. These data are available in FAO''s database FAOSTAT.
  The numerator captures the three dimensions of sustainable production: environmental,
  economic and social. The measurement instrument '' farm surveys '' will give countries
  the flexibility to identify issues related to sustainability that are most relevant
  to priorities/challenges within these three dimensions. Land under productive and
  sustainable agriculture will be those farms that satisfy indicators selected across
  all three dimension'
