rationale_interpretation: "From UNICEF: \nFGM/C is a violation of girls' and women's human rights. There is also a large body of literature documenting the adverse health consequences of FGM/C over both the short and long term. FGM/C is condemned by a number of international treaties and conventions including the Universal Declaration of Human Right (Article 25). FGM/C can also be considered as a form of violence against women, and therefore the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women can be invoked. Similarly, defining it as a form of torture brings it under the rubric of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Moreover, since FGM/C is regarded as a traditional practice prejudicial to the health of children and is, in most cases, performed on minors, it violates the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Existing national legislation in many countries also include explicit bans against FGM/C. \n\nFrom WHO: \n Female genital mutilation (FGM) comprises all procedures that involve the partial or total removal of external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons [1]. Although it is internationally recognized as a violation of human rights (including: the right to non-discrimination on the grounds of sex; the right to life; the right to the highest attainable standard of health; the right to freedom From torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; and the rights of the child), and legislation to prohibit the procedure has been put in place in many countries, the practice has still been documented. \nWHO classifies FGM into four types: [1] \n\tType I: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce (clitoridectomy). \n\tType II: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora (excision). \n\tType III: Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with the creation of a covering seal by cutting and appositioning the labia minora and/or the labia majora, with or without excision of the clitoris (infibulation). \n\tType IV: All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example: pricking, pulling, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization. \nThe removal of or damage to healthy, normal genital tissue interferes with the natural functioning of the body and causes several immediate and long-term health consequences."

target: 'Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation.'
indicator_definition: 'From UNICEF: This indicator provides the proportion of girls and women aged 15 to 49 years who have undergone female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C). It is calculated by dividing the number of girls and women aged 15-49 who have undergone FGM/C by the total number of girls and women aged 15-49 in the population From WHO: The numerator is the number of women and girls who have undergone a FGM procedure (Type 1 to IV). The denominator is the number of women and girls in the same population'
