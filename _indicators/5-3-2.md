  From UNICEF: This indicator provides the proportion of girls and women aged 15
  to 49 years who have undergone female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C). It
  is calculated by dividing the number of girls and women aged 15-49 who have
  undergone FGM/C by the total number of girls and women aged 15-49 in the
  population From WHO: The numerator is the number of women and girls who have
  undergone a FGM procedure (Type 1 to IV). The denominator is the number of
  women and girls in the same population
