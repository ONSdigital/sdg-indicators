indicator_name: (a) Proportion of total agricultural population with ownership or
  secure rights over agricultural land, by sex; and (b) share of women among owners
  or rightsbearers of agricultural land, type of tenure
target: Undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well
  as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial
  services, inheritance and natural resources, in accordance with national laws.
indicator_definition: "The indicator is divided in two parts: (a) measures the incidence
  of people with ownership or secure rights over agricultural land among the total
  agricultural population; while (b) focusses on the gender parity measuring the extent
  to which women are disadvantaged in ownership or rights over agricultural land.
  Part (a) and part (b) cannot be seen as two different indicators, they rather provide
  two complementary information. Plus, they can be computed using (almost) the same
  data, the main difference between the 2 parts being only the denominator.  Definition
  of agricultural land: Since Target 1.4 explicitly refers to equal rights on economic
  resources, the proposed indicator focuses on land that can be used as a productive
  resource for livelihood development, thus the focus on agricultural land. The focus
  on land as productive resource (or for livelihood development) helps deriving indication
  on empowerment and advancement towards poverty reduction, compared to lands used
  for other purposes that are not economically and livelihood-related. This is particularly
  true in developing countries where poverty reduction strategies are necessarily
  linked to agricultural development. The term 'agricultural land' is used to indicate
  land used for farming, livestock and forestry activities. This emphasizes the importance
  to monitor ownership/secure rights on land of farm-based livelihood people as well
  as people whose main source of livelihood is livestock and forestry. Similarly the
  term 'agricultural population' has to be intended in a broad sense ' i.e. including
  people living out of farming, livestock and forestry, with land rights or without
  (landless). Definition of ownership and rights over land: The landowner is the legal
  owner of the land. Definitions of ownership may vary across countries and surveys.
  For instance, documented ownership means that ownership is verified through title
  or deed, while reported ownership relies on individuals' own judgment. Reported
  ownership may be more appropriate in countries where a formal registration system
  is not in place. Additionally, in some countries, particularly where land private
  ownership is not applicable, it is more appropriate to investigate rights over land
  using proxies able to capture individuals' capability to control and take decisions
  over the land. This may include settings where customary rights prevail as opposed
  to individual ownership. Proxies of such \"bundle of rights\" may include the right
  to sell, to bequeath or the right to decide how to use the land. Since the definition
  of ownership and land rights has to take into account what is more relevant in the
  country, the indicator will need to be complemented with metadata that specify what
  definition(s) of ownership or rights over land is/are employed. Tenure Type Finally
  and most importantly, this indicator has to be disaggregated by type of tenure.
  Therefore, the data collection methodology should always include a question on land
  tenure. Land tenure refers to the arrangements or rights under which people have
  access to land, and it is one of the key elements to tenure security.5 There are
  different formal and informal tenure systems around the world and the distinction
  between legal and non-legal tenure is often blurred. When available, the indicator
  shall also be disaggregated by documented tenure rights. The FAO World Census of
  Agriculture encourages countries to use country-specific types of tenure whilst
  ensuring the possibility to classify ex-post under the following broad categories:
  1) legal ownership or legal owner-like possession; 2) Non-legal ownership or non-legal
  owner-like possession; 3) Rented land from someone else; 4) Various other types
  of land tenure. Broadly speaking, legal ownership or legal owner-like possession
  describes land rights that provide statutory security of tenure. This may be done
  through a formal land title system, but may also include certain forms of customary
  land tenure arrangements where land rights are registered or certified in some way.
  The following types of tenure arrangements may be included under this heading: \tOwnership
  is certified through a title, which gives the individual the right to determine
  the nature and extent of the use of the land. \tLand is held under conditions that
  enable it to be operated as if legally owned. E.g., the land is operated under hereditary
  tenure, perpetual lease, or long-term lease, with nominal or no rent. \tThe land
  is held under a tribal, communal, or traditional form of tenure, which is legally
  recognized by the state. Such arrangements usually involve land being held on a
  tribal, village, kindred or clan basis, with land ownership being communal in character
  but with certain individual rights being held by virtue of membership in the social
  unit. Such arrangements can be formalized through the establishment of legal procedures
  to identify the community's land and to manage the land rights of community members."
