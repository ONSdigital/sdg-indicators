indicator_name: Proportion of women in managerial positions
target: Ensure women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for
  leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life
indicator_definition: "The indicator proposed measures the proportion of women in
  leadership positions across a number of areas, including: \tin the executive branch
  of government: \t\tNumber of women Heads of State and Governments as a percentage
  of total (Tier 1) \t\tNumber of ministerial positions that are held by women as
  a percentage of total (Tier 1 ' part of Minimum set of gender indicators) \t\tNumber
  of leadership positions held by women in local governments as a percentage of total
  (Tier 3) \tin the legislative branch of government: \t\tNumber of seats in national
  parliaments held by women as a percentage of total (Tier 1 ' part of Minimum set
  of gender indicators) \tin the judiciary branch of government and law enforcement:
  \t\tNumber of women judges as a percentage of total (Tier 2 - ' part of Minimum
  set of gender indicators) \t\tNumber of women police officers as a percentage of
  total (Tier 2 ' part of Minimum set of gender indicators) ; and \tthe share of managers
  in public and private sector enterprises that are women (Tier 1 ' part of Minimum
  set of gender indicators). Some of these data are already collected while others
  need further development. For example, UN Women routinely collects data on women
  Heads of State and Government; the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) regularly collects
  data on the proportion of women ministers and in parliaments; indicators on women
  in law enforcement are also readily available; and ILO regularly publishes data
  on women managers using data from national labour force surveys. Data on women's
  political participation at the local level have not been as systematically collected
  at the global level. Measuring women's participation in local government is important,
  however, because of the responsibilities of local governments and the significantly
  higher number of opportunities (that is, seats) available to women candidates at
  this level. To measure women's representation in local governments, methodologies
  and standards are currently being developed by UN Women and United Cities and Local
  Governments (UCLG)."
