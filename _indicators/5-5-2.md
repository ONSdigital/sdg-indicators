  Women participate in politics and decision-making at all levels, in different
  functions and across all spheres. They participate as candidates for local,
  regional and national elections, members of parliament or local council, heads
  of state and government, ministers, members of political parties, leaders and
  managers of business. Capturing an accurate assessment of women's
  representation across these different forms of political and economic
  leadership is a key marker of progress in achieving gender equality and
  women's empowerment.

indicator_name: Proportion of women in managerial positions
target: >-
  Ensure women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for
  leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public
  life
indicator_definition: "The indicator proposed measures the proportion of women in leadership positions across a number of areas, including: \tin the executive branch of government: \t\tNumber of women Heads of State and Governments as a percentage of total (Tier 1) \t\tNumber of ministerial positions that are held by women as a percentage of total (Tier 1 ' part of Minimum set of gender indicators) \t\tNumber of leadership positions held by women in local governments as a percentage of total (Tier 3) \tin the legislative branch of government: \t\tNumber of seats in national parliaments held by women as a percentage of total (Tier 1 ' part of Minimum set of gender indicators) \tin the judiciary branch of government and law enforcement: \t\tNumber of women judges as a percentage of total (Tier 2 - ' part of Minimum set of gender indicators) \t\tNumber of women police officers as a percentage of total (Tier 2 ' part of Minimum set of gender indicators) ; and \tthe share of managers in public and private sector enterprises that are women (Tier 1 ' part of Minimum set of gender indicators). Some of these data are already collected while others need further development. For example, UN Women routinely collects data on women Heads of State and Government; the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) regularly collects data on the proportion of women ministers and in parliaments; indicators on women in law enforcement are also readily available; and ILO regularly publishes data on women managers using data from national labour force surveys. Data on women's political participation at the local level have not been as systematically collected at the global level. Measuring women's participation in local government is important, however, because of the responsibilities of local governments and the significantly higher number of opportunities (that is, seats) available to women candidates at this level. To measure women's representation in local governments, methodologies and standards are currently being developed by UN Women and United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG)."

  Data collected prior to 2010 is not comparable to data collected from 2010 to
  present. Hence, no data is shown for years prior to 2010.

  Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree
  of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is
  represented through the use of a margin of error. The margin of error for the
  data provided is +/-.2 (this is the 90 percent margin of error). The margin of
  error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that
  the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the
  estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds)
  contains the true value.  In addition to sampling variability, the ACS
  estimates are subject to nonsampling error. The effect of nonsampling error is
  not represented in these data. Occupation codes are 4-digit codes and are
  based on Standard Occupational Classification 2010.
