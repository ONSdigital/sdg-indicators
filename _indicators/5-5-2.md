  The International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) organizes jobs into a clearly defined set of groups according to the tasks and duties undertaken in the job. The first version of ISCO was published in 1958 and since then, ISCO has been revised in 1968, 1988 and 2008. Employed persons are all persons of working age who during a specified brief period, such as one week or one day, were in the following categories: i) paid employment (whether at work or with a job but not at work); or  ii) self-employment (whether at work or with an enterprise but not at work). For more detailed information, please refer to the Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization, adopted by the Nineteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (October 2013): http://ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-byinternational-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm.
