indicator_name: "Progress by countries in the degree of implementation of international instruments aiming to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing"
target: "By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation."
indicator_definition: "The indicator \"Productivity of aquaculture in utilizing natural resources (land, water and wild stock)\"is to provide for a measure the of the productivity of the aquaculture production process, and is defined as the value and volume of aquaculture production per unit amount of natural resource utilized in the aquaculture production process. \nDimensions: \nAquaculture production in volumes (tons in live weight or live weight equivalent) and first-sale (farmgate) value (USD x1000). \nUtilized natural resources: \n\t1. Land area (hectares), as land cover, to include both land and inland water surface areas used for production process, including hatchery, nursery, overwintering and out-growing, (e.g. pond, tank or raceway water surface or inland water surface area allocated/licensed for aquaculture operations using cages, pens or other structures) as well as for supporting areas (e.g. pond dikes, water supply and drainage canals and water treatment facilities, etc.). [This corresponds to an aggregated area of 1.3 and 2.1 of SEEA Land Use classification]; \n\tSea areas (hectares) allocated/licensed for aquaculture production operations using cages, pens, rafts, stakes, poles, ropes and lines and other structures. [This corresponds to 4.1 and part of 3.1 SEEA Land Use classification, excluding the area of 'Seabed and intertidal areas'.] \n\tSeabed and intertidal areas (hectares) allocated/licensed for aquaculture production operations (e.g. cultivation of molluscs, sea cucumber and sea urchins, etc., using bottomsowing, table, bags and baskets and other structures). [This corresponds to a part of 3.1 of SEEA Land Use classification] \n\tReference should be made to the Land use classification of adopted in the System of EnvironmentalEconomic Accounting 2012 ' Central Framework ( http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/ seeaRev/SEEA_CF_Final_en.pdf, relevant classification available at Appendix I-B of pages 289 ' 299). \n\tRelevant classifications include: \n\t1.3 ' Land used for aquaculture, \n\t2.1 ' Inland waters used for aquaculture or holding facilities, \n\t3.1 ' Coastal waters used for aquaculture or holding facilities, and \n\t4.1 ' EEZ areas used for aquaculture or holding facilities. \n\t2. Water volumes (m3) used during production process. \n\t3. Wild stock, as fish stocks captured for two main purposes: \n\t\t(i) landed in volumes (tons in live weight or live weight equivalent) for direct use as feed or for reduction as fish meal and fish oil as feed ingredients for fed aquaculture species, and \n\t\t(ii) caught in numbers or volume in tons in live weight for use as seed / stocking materials for aquaculture grow-out facilities (capture-based aquaculture)"
