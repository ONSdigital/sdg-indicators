indicator_name: Progress by countries in the degree of implementation of international
  instruments aiming to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing
target: By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to
  overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported
  and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing
  that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing
  and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization
  fisheries subsidies negotiation.
indicator_definition: "The indicator \"Productivity of aquaculture in utilizing natural
  resources (land, water and wild stock)\"is to provide for a measure the of the productivity
  of the aquaculture production process, and is defined as the value and volume of
  aquaculture production per unit amount of natural resource utilized in the aquaculture
  production process. Dimensions: Aquaculture production in volumes (tons in live
  weight or live weight equivalent) and first-sale (farmgate) value (USD x1000). Utilized
  natural resources: \t1. Land area (hectares), as land cover, to include both land
  and inland water surface areas used for production process, including hatchery,
  nursery, overwintering and out-growing, (e.g. pond, tank or raceway water surface
  or inland water surface area allocated/licensed for aquaculture operations using
  cages, pens or other structures) as well as for supporting areas (e.g. pond dikes,
  water supply and drainage canals and water treatment facilities, etc.). [This corresponds
  to an aggregated area of 1.3 and 2.1 of SEEA Land Use classification]; \tSea areas
  (hectares) allocated/licensed for aquaculture production operations using cages,
  pens, rafts, stakes, poles, ropes and lines and other structures. [This corresponds
  to 4.1 and part of 3.1 SEEA Land Use classification, excluding the area of 'Seabed
  and intertidal areas'.] \tSeabed and intertidal areas (hectares) allocated/licensed
  for aquaculture production operations (e.g. cultivation of molluscs, sea cucumber
  and sea urchins, etc., using bottomsowing, table, bags and baskets and other structures).
  [This corresponds to a part of 3.1 of SEEA Land Use classification] \tReference
  should be made to the Land use classification of adopted in the System of EnvironmentalEconomic
  Accounting 2012 ' Central Framework ( http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/
  seeaRev/SEEA_CF_Final_en.pdf, relevant classification available at Appendix I-B
  of pages 289 ' 299). \tRelevant classifications include: \t1.3 ' Land used for aquaculture,
  \t2.1 ' Inland waters used for aquaculture or holding facilities, \t3.1 ' Coastal
  waters used for aquaculture or holding facilities, and \t4.1 ' EEZ areas used for
  aquaculture or holding facilities. \t2. Water volumes (m3) used during production
  process. \t3. Wild stock, as fish stocks captured for two main purposes: \t\t(i)
  landed in volumes (tons in live weight or live weight equivalent) for direct use
  as feed or for reduction as fish meal and fish oil as feed ingredients for fed aquaculture
  species, and \t\t(ii) caught in numbers or volume in tons in live weight for use
  as seed / stocking materials for aquaculture grow-out facilities (capture-based
  aquaculture)"
