comments_limitations: 'Weighted Data are only available from 2000 onwards. Estimates
  prior to 2005 as based upon fiscal years as opposed to calendar years, therefore
  estimates for 2004 and 2005 both include the period 1 January 2005 to 31 March 2005.
  Data are only available before 2014 for Age, Sex, Employment Status, and Presence
  of Dependent Children Living in Household. Data are available from 2014 for Highest
  Qualification Level, Incomes, Socio-economic classification, Relationship Status,
  and Pregnancy Status.  '

computation_calculations: 'No calculations were performed in the data acquisition
  of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format
  specified by this indicator. For insight into the details of potential calculations
  please refer to the original source metadata or source contact. A basic summary
  of the concept  behind the formation of the indicator is as follows:  In order to
  calculate the percentage of people who are current cigarette smokers aged 16 years
  and older; divide the number of cigarette smokers, aged 16 years and older, by the
  total population, aged 16 years and older, and multiply the output figure by 100.'
computation_numerator: 100 x Number of Smokers (Aged 16 and Older)
computation_denominator: Total Population (Aged 16 and Older)
computation_definitions: International Labour Organisation (ILO) definitions of economic
  activity are used. Unemployed people are those who are not currently in work but
  who are looking for work.
