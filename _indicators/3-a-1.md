actual_indicator_available_description: Percentage of UK population aged 18 and over who are daily smokers
us_method_of_computation: >-
  Percentage of persons who are daily smokers is based on responses to two
  questions from the National Health Interview Survey: “Have you smoked at least
  100 cigarettes in your entire life?” and “Do you now smoke cigarettes every
  day, some days, or not at all?” Daily smokers are adults who have smoked 100
  cigarettes in their lifetime and currently smoke every day.  Percentages are
  generated using samplinng survey weights to make nationally representative
  population estimates.

computation_disaggregation: >-
  This data is disaggregated by Age, Sex, Highest Qualification Level, Income,
  Employment Status, Socio-economic classification, Relationship Status,
  Presence of Dependent Children Living in Household, and Pregnancy Status. Some
  of these disaggregation can be further disaggregated amongst each other. 
comments_limitations: >-
  Weighted Data are only available from 2000 onwards. Estimates prior to 2005 as
  based upon fiscal years as opposed to calendar years, therefore estimates for
  2004 and 2005 both include the period 1 January 2005 to 31 March 2005. Data
  are only available before 2014 for Age, Sex, Employment Status, and Presence
  of Dependent Children Living in Household. Data are available from 2014 for
  Highest Qualification Level, Incomes, Socio-economic classification,
  Relationship Status, and Pregnancy Status.

computation_calculations: >-
  No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as
  appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this
  indicator. For insight into the details of potential calculations please refer
  to the original source metadata or source contact. A basic summary of the
  concept  behind the formation of the indicator is as follows:  In order to
  calculate the percentage of people who are current cigarette smokers aged 16
  years and older; divide the number of cigarette smokers, aged 16 years and
  older, by the total population, aged 16 years and older, and multiply the
  output figure by 100.
computation_numerator: 100 x Number of Smokers (Aged 16 and Older)
computation_denominator: Total Population (Aged 16 and Older)
computation_definitions: >-
  International Labour Organisation (ILO) definitions of economic activity are
  used. Unemployed people are those who are not currently in work but who are
  looking for work.
