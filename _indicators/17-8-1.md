indicator_definition: >-
  This indicator is defined as the proportion of individuals who used the
  Internet from any location in the last three months. The Internet is a
  worldwide public computer network. It provides access to a number of
  communication services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news,
  entertainment and data files, irrespective of the device used (not assumed to
  be only via a computer _ it may also be by mobile telephone, tablet, PDA,
  games machine, digital TV etc.). Access can be via a fixed or mobile network.
  For countries that collect data on this indicator through an official survey,
  this indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of in-scope
  individuals using the Internet (from any location) in the last 3 months by the
  total number of in-scope individuals. For countries that have not carried out
  an official survey, data are estimated (by ITU) based on the number of
  Internet subscriptions and other socioeconomic indicators such as for example
  GNI per capita, and on the time series data of the indicator.
