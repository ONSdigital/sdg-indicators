indicator_name: Proportion of individuals using the Internet
target: Fully operationalize the technology bank and science, technology and innovation
  capacity-building mechanism for least developed countries by 2017 and enhance the
  use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology.
indicator_definition: This indicator is defined as the proportion of individuals who
  used the Internet from any location in the last three months. The Internet is a
  worldwide public computer network. It provides access to a number of communication
  services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and
  data files, irrespective of the device used (not assumed to be only via a computer
  _ it may also be by mobile telephone, tablet, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.).
  Access can be via a fixed or mobile network. For countries that collect data on
  this indicator through an official survey, this indicator is calculated by dividing
  the total number of in-scope individuals using the Internet (from any location)
  in the last 3 months by the total number of in-scope individuals. For countries
  that have not carried out an official survey, data are estimated (by ITU) based
  on the number of Internet subscriptions and other socioeconomic indicators such
  as for example GNI per capita, and on the time series data of the indicator.
