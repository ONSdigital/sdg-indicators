indicator_name: Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services,
  including a hand-washing facility with soap and water
target: By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for
  all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and
  girls and those in vulnerable situations.
indicator_definition: Population using a basic sanitation facility at the household
  level ('improved' sanitation facilities used for MDG monitoring i.e. flush or pour
  flush toilets to sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved
  pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting toilets, the same categories
  as improved sources of drinking water used for MDG monitoring) which is not shared
  with other households and where excreta is safely disposed in situ or treated off-site.
  This is therefore a multipurpose indicator also serving the household element of
  the wastewater treatment indicator (6.3.1).
