  Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water

target: >-
  By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations

  Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water
indicator_definition: >-
  The Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water is currently being measured by the proportion of the population using a basic
  sanitation facility which is not shared with other households and where excreta is safely disposed in situ or treated off-site. ‘Improved’ sanitation facilities include: flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems,
  septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting toilets.
national_indicator_available: Percentage of the population connected to wastewater treatment

national_indicator_description: >-
  National population connected to a systems of conduits which collects and conducts urban wastewater. Collecting systems are often operated by public authorities or semi-public associations.

computation_definitions: >-
  Tertiary treatment: treatment (additional to secondary treatment) of nitrogen and/or phosphorus and/or any other pollutant affecting the quality or a specific use of water (microbiological pollution, colour etc.). The different possible treatment efficiencies (organic pollution removal of at least 95% for BOD, 85% for COD, nitrogen removal of at least 70%, phosphorus removal of at least 80%, and microbiological removal) cannot be added and are exclusive.
  Secondary treatment: treatment of (urban) wastewater by a process generally involving biological treatment with a secondary settlement or other process, resulting in a BOD removal of at least 70% and a COD removal of at least 75%.
  Primary treatment: treatment of (urban) wastewater by a physical and/or chemical process involving settlement of suspended solids, or other process in which the BOD5 of the incoming wastewater are reduced by at least 20% before discharge and the total suspended solids of the incoming wastewater are reduced by at least 50%.

comments_limitations: >-
  A framework for measuring faecal waste flows and safety factors has been developed and piloted in 12 countries (World Bank Water and Sanitation Program, 2014), and is being adopted and scaled up within the sanitation sector. This framework has served as the basis for indicators 6.2.1 and 6.3.1. Data on safe disposal and treatment are not available for all countries. However, sufficient data were available to make global and regional estimates of safely managed sanitation services in 2017. Presence of a handwashing station with soap and water does not guarantee that household members consistently wash hands at key times, but has been accepted as the most suitable proxy. Data were available for 70 countries in 2017. At present, UK data does not account for homeless rough sleepers.
