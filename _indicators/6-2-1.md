rationale_interpretation: "Predominant type of statistics:\nNational estimates adjusted for global comparison. MDG target 7C called for 'sustainable access' to ''basic sanitation'. JMP developed the metric of use of 'improved' sanitation facilities, which are likely to hygienically separate human excreta from human contact, and has used this indicator to track progress towards the MDG target since 2000. International consultations since 2011 have established consensus on the need to build on and address the shortcomings of this indicator; specifically, to address normative criteria of the human right to water including accessibility, acceptability, and safety. Furthermore, the safe management of faecal wastes should be considered, as discharges of untreated wastewater into the environment create public health hazards. \nThe above consultation concluded that post-2015 targets, which apply to all countries, should go beyond the basic level of access and address indicators of safe management of sanitation services, including dimensions of accessibility, acceptability and safety. The Expert Working Group called for analysis of faecal waste management along the sanitation chain, including containment, emptying of latrines and septic tanks, and safe on-site disposal or transport of wastes to designated treatment sites. Classification of treatment will be based on categories defined by SEEA and the International Recommendations for Water Statistics and following a laddered approach (primary, secondary and tertiary treatment),"

indicator_name: 'Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water'
target: 'By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.'
indicator_definition: 'Population using a basic sanitation facility at the household level (''improved'' sanitation facilities used for MDG monitoring i.e. flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting toilets, the same categories as improved sources of drinking water used for MDG monitoring) which is not shared with other households and where excreta is safely disposed in situ or treated off-site. This is therefore a multipurpose indicator also serving the household element of the wastewater treatment indicator (6.3.1).'

method_of_computation: 'Household surveys and censuses provide data on use of types of basic sanitation facilities listed above. The percentage of the population using safely managed sanitation services is calculated by combining data on the proportion of the population using different types of basic sanitation facilities with estimates of the proportion of faecal waste which is safely disposed in situ or treated off-site. The JMP estimates access to basic sanitation facilities for each country, separately in urban and rural areas, by fitting a regression line to a series of data points from household surveys and censuses. This approach was used to report on use of ''improved sanitation'' facilities for MDG monitoring. The JMP is evaluating the use of alternative statistical estimation methods as more data become available. The Statistical Note describes in more detail how ''safety factors'', or the proportion of household wastewater that is safely disposed of in situ or transported to a designated place, will be generated through a national assessment process, and combined with data on use of different types of supplies, as recorded in the current JMP database. Calculation of safety factors for safe management of sanitation are the same used for safety factors for wastewater treatment required for household part of the indicator 6.3.1.'
