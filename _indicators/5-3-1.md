  The estimates are based on marriages occurring within England and Wales only.
  Estimates do not include or take account of marriages occurring abroad either
  before migrating to England and Wales or whilst as a resident of England and
  Wales. Estimates are based on the Population estimates by Marital Status,
  specifically the population who are 'Single, never married or civil
  partnered'. Migrants will be included within these population estimates.
  Estimates try to indicate behaviour by exact age 18 and do not take into
  account; death, divorce or migration which could occur by age 24.

Data availability within the UK is limited to England and Wales for this indicator.
