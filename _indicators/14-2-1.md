  Percentage of exclusive economic zone (including territorial waters)

computation_units: Percentage (%)
computation_definitions: >-
  The extent of protected areas measures are a calculation of the net
  (non-overlapping) extent of protected areas using mean high water as the
  boundary between the at-sea and on-land measures.

  An exclusive economic zone  is a sea zone prescribed by the United Nations
  Convention on the Law of the Sea over which a state has special rights
  regarding the exploration and use of marine resources, including energy
  production from water and wind. It stretches from the baseline to 200 nautical
  miles from coast.
