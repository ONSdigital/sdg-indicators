  approaches
target: By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid
  significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take
  action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans
indicator_definition: While requiring some further development for practical implementation,
  the indicator is similar to UNEP indicators to monitor progress on marine and coastal
  EBM under its biannual programme of work. UNEP, IOC and FAO are available to support
  countries in operationalizing the indicator. Linkages can be explored with IUCN's
