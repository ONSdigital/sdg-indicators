rationale_interpretation: 'Moreover, 18 Regional Seas Conventions and Action Plans are currently working to develop a core set of common indicators to be used across regional seas for routing monitoring and reporting on the status of the marine environment. Several proposed indicators are relevant to 14.2, for example: (a) National ICZM guidelines and enabling legislation adopted; (b) Number of existing national and local coastal and marine plans incorporating climate change adaptation; (c) % national adaptation plans in place; (d) Fisheries measures in place (by-catch limits, area-based closures, recovery plans, capacity reduction measures); (e) Trends in critical habitat extent and condition; (f) Population pressure/urbanization: Length of coastal modification and km2 of coastal reclamation.'

indicator_name: 'Proportion of national exclusive economic zones managed using ecosystem-based approaches'
target: 'By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.'
indicator_definition: 'While requiring some further development for practical implementation, the indicator is similar to UNEP indicators to monitor progress on marine and coastal EBM under its biannual programme of work. UNEP, IOC and FAO are available to support countries in operationalizing the indicator. Linkages can be explored with IUCN''s ''Green List'' and the ''Ocean Health Index''. A technical working group to finalise the details could be supported by UNEP, IOC, FAO winter/spring 2016.'
