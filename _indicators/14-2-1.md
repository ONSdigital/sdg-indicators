  Moreover, 18 Regional Seas Conventions and Action Plans are currently working
  to develop a core set of common indicators to be used across regional seas for
  routing monitoring and reporting on the status of the marine environment.
  Several proposed indicators are relevant to 14.2, for example: (a) National
  ICZM guidelines and enabling legislation adopted; (b) Number of existing
  national and local coastal and marine plans incorporating climate change
  adaptation; (c) % national adaptation plans in place; (d) Fisheries measures
  in place (by-catch limits, area-based closures, recovery plans, capacity
  reduction measures); (e) Trends in critical habitat extent and condition; (f)
  Population pressure/urbanization: Length of coastal modification and km2 of
  coastal reclamation.

  Proportion of national exclusive economic zones managed using ecosystem-based
  approaches
target: >-
  By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid
  significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and
  take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive
  oceans.
indicator_definition: >-
  While requiring some further development for practical implementation, the
  indicator is similar to UNEP indicators to monitor progress on marine and
  coastal EBM under its biannual programme of work. UNEP, IOC and FAO are
  available to support countries in operationalizing the indicator. Linkages can
  be explored with IUCN's 'Green List' and the 'Ocean Health Index'. A technical
  working group to finalise the details could be supported by UNEP, IOC, FAO
  winter/spring 2016.
