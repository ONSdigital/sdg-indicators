rationale_interpretation: "Laws and justice systems shape society by ensuring accountability, stopping the abuse of power and creating norms about what is acceptable. Removing discriminatory laws and putting in place laws and policies that promote gender equality is a prerequisite to ending discrimination against women and girls. \nBecause this indicator monitors laws, it focuses on de-jure equality between women and men and girls and boys and instances where legal frameworks promote gender equality and women's empowerment. This is not to say that de-facto inequality should not be prioritized. In fact, even where discrimination is explicitly prohibited by law, unequal outcomes between women and men and boys and girls can be the result of discriminatory practices that prevent women and girls from enjoying their human rights. \nMost of the indicators proposed to monitor the targets in SDG5 and the genderrelated indicators to monitor the targets in the other goals focus on outcomes. By focusing on laws, it is possible to juxtapose the different areas of law that are measured under 5.1 (e.g. laws to prevent sexual assault) to the actual 'results' (rates of sexual violence against women and girls as measured in target 5.2). Therefore, the proposed focus on laws and policies is meant to complement the outcome indicators proposed under the other targets in Goal 5 and the gender-related targets in other goals."

indicator_name: 'Whether or not legal frameworks are in place to promote, enforce and monitor equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex'
target: 'End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere.'
indicator_definition: 'The indicator measures whether national laws exist to promote gender equality and non-discrimination against women and girls. Areas of law to be monitored as part of this indicator are tentative but could include: whether equal pay for work of equal value is guaranteed in law; whether national legislation is in line with International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 183 on maternity protection; whether national law prohibits discrimination based on a definition of discrimination against women in accordance with article 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW); whether the national law provides equal rights for women and men with respect to inheritance and property; and the existence of laws (including criminal) against sexual assault. For each area of law under consideration, the indicator is the number of countries with specific legislation to promote gender equality and non-discrimination (i.e. countries with ''yes'') as a percentage of all countries with available data. A simple aggregation method (e.g. arithmetic or geometric mean) will then be used to calculate global and/or regional averages (taking into account all of the different areas of laws).'
