indicator_name: Whether or not legal frameworks are in place to promote, enforce and
  monitor equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex
target: End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere.
indicator_definition: 'The indicator measures whether national laws exist to promote
  gender equality and non-discrimination against women and girls. Areas of law to
  be monitored as part of this indicator are tentative but could include: whether
  equal pay for work of equal value is guaranteed in law; whether national legislation
  is in line with International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 183 on maternity
  protection; whether national law prohibits discrimination based on a definition
  of discrimination against women in accordance with article 1 of the Convention on
  the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW); whether the
  national law provides equal rights for women and men with respect to inheritance
  and property; and the existence of laws (including criminal) against sexual assault.
  For each area of law under consideration, the indicator is the number of countries
  with specific legislation to promote gender equality and non-discrimination (i.e.
  countries with ''yes'') as a percentage of all countries with available data. A
  simple aggregation method (e.g. arithmetic or geometric mean) will then be used
  to calculate global and/or regional averages (taking into account all of the different
  areas of laws).'
