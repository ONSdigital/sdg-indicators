indicator_definition: 'The share of informal employment in total non-agriculture employment
  refers to employment in informal jobs expressed as a percentage of total non-agriculture
  employment. Informal employment comprises persons who in their main or secondary
  jobs were: (a) Own-account workers, employers and members of producers'' cooperatives
  employed in their own informal sector enterprises. The informal nature of their
  jobs follows directly from the characteristics of the enterprise; (b) Own-account
  workers engaged in the production of goods exclusively for own final use by their
  household (e.g. subsistence farming or do-it-yourself construction of own dwellings),
  if covered; (c) Contributing family workers, irrespective of whether they work in
  formal or informal sector enterprises. The informal nature of their jobs is due
  to the fact that contributing family workers usually do not have explicit, written
  contracts of employment, and that usually their employment is not subject to labour
  legislation, social security regulations, collective agreements, etc.; (e) Employees
  holding informal jobs, whether employed by formal sector enterprises, informal sector
  enterprises, or as paid domestic workers by households. Employees are considered
  to have informal jobs if their employment relationship is, in law or in practice,
  not subject to national labour legislation, income taxation, social protection or
  entitlement to certain employment benefits (paid annual or sick leave, etc.) for
  reasons such as: non-declaration of the jobs or the employees; casual jobs or jobs
  of a limited short duration; jobs with hours of work or wages below a specified
  threshold (e.g. for social security contributions); employment by unincorporated
  enterprises or by persons in households; jobs where the employee''s place of work
  is outside the premises of the employer''s enterprise (e.g. outworkers without employment
  contract); or jobs, for which labour regulations are not applied, not enforced,
  or not complied with for any other reason. Operational criteria used by countries
  to define informal jobs of employees include lack of coverage by social security
  system, lack of entitlement to paid annual or sick leave, or lack of written employment
  contract. '
