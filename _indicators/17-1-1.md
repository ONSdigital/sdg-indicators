  In the OECD classification the term “taxes” is defined as compulsory unrequited payments to general government. The definition of government follows that of the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA). As disagregations of general government, central government here refers to the government of the United Kingdom and local government refers, collectivly, to the administration of counties or districts, with representatives elected by those who live there.
