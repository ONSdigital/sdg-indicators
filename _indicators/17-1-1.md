  The headline measure presents the total tax revenues received by the national
  government during the year, expressed as a percentage of GDP ' i.e., total
  national income. Taxes include personal and corporate income taxes, taxes on
  property, value added taxes, excise taxes, tariffs, customs duties and social
  security contributions. The tax to GDP ratio is the leading indicator to
  estimate the financial domestic means of a government to conduct its
  programme, to raise resources to supply physical infrastructure, public goods
  and services. The tax to GDP ratio supports the development of effective tax
  systems and is an essential feature of a successful governance framework.
  Normalising the data, by dividing total revenues by GDP, enables easy
  comparisons across countries Comparable and consistent tax statistics, such as
  the tax to GDP ratio, facilitate transparent policy dialogue and provide
  policy makers with an important tool to assess alternative fiscal reforms and
  to undertake relevant policy actions.

  other revenue collection.
indicator_definition: >-
  Total taxes as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In the OECD
  classification the term "taxes" is defined as compulsory unrequited payments
  to general government. The definition of government follows that of the 2008
  System of National Accounts (SNA). The important parts of the SNA's conceptual
  framework and its definitions of the various sectors of the economy have been
  reflected in the OECD's classification of taxes. The data are predominantly
  recorded on an accrual basis. Data on tax revenues are recorded without
  offsets for the administrative expenses connected with tax collection. GDP
  also follows the definition used in the SNA. The methodology used in compiling
  the OECD's internally comparable revenue statistics has been carefully
  developed and refined through consultation with national statisticians and tax
  policy makers for more than 40 years. It continues to evolve.
