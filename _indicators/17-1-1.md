indicator_name: Total government revenue as a proportion of GDP, by source
target: Strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international
  support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax and other
  revenue collection.
indicator_definition: Total taxes as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
  In the OECD classification the term "taxes" is defined as compulsory unrequited
  payments to general government. The definition of government follows that of the
  2008 System of National Accounts (SNA). The important parts of the SNA's conceptual
  framework and its definitions of the various sectors of the economy have been reflected
  in the OECD's classification of taxes. The data are predominantly recorded on an
  accrual basis. Data on tax revenues are recorded without offsets for the administrative
  expenses connected with tax collection. GDP also follows the definition used in
  the SNA. The methodology used in compiling the OECD's internally comparable revenue
  statistics has been carefully developed and refined through consultation with national
  statisticians and tax policy makers for more than 40 years. It continues to evolve.
