  Material Footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per
  GDP
target: >-
  Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption
  and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental
  degradation, in accordance with the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on
  Sustainable Consumption and Production, with developed countries taking the
  lead .
indicator_definition: >-
  Material footprint (MF) is the attribution of global material extraction to
  domestic final demand of a country. It is calculated as raw material
  equivalent of imports (RMEIM) plus domestic extraction (DE) minus raw material
  equivalents of exports (RMEEX). For the attribution of the primary material
  needs of final demand a global, multi_regional input_output (MRIO) framework
  is employed. The attribution method based on I_O analytical tools is described
  in detail in Wiedmann et al. 2015. It is based on the EORA MRIO framework
  developed by the University of Sydney, Australia (Lenzen et al. 2013) which is
  an internationally well_established and the most detailed and reliable MRIO
  framework available to date.
