indicator_name: Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint
  per GDP
target: Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption
  and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation,
  in accordance with the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption
  and production, with developed countries taking the lead.
indicator_definition: Material footprint (MF) is the attribution of global material
  extraction to domestic final demand of a country. It is calculated as raw material
  equivalent of imports (RMEIM) plus domestic extraction (DE) minus raw material equivalents
  of exports (RMEEX). For the attribution of the primary material needs of final demand
  a global, multi_regional input_output (MRIO) framework is employed. The attribution
  method based on I_O analytical tools is described in detail in Wiedmann et al. 2015.
  It is based on the EORA MRIO framework developed by the University of Sydney, Australia
  (Lenzen et al. 2013) which is an internationally well_established and the most detailed
  and reliable MRIO framework available to date.
