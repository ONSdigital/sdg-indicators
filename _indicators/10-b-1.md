  Figures may not sum to totals due to roundings.  In the CRS (Creditor
  Reporting System), data on the sector of destination are recorded using
  5-digit purpose codes.  The first three digits of the code refer to the
  corresponding DAC5 sector or category.  Each CRS code belongs to one and only
  one DAC5 category.  Generally, the last two digits of the CRS purpose code are
  sequential and not hierarchical i.e., each CRS code stands for itself and can
  be selected individually or grouped to create sub-sectors. The Governance and
  civil society, general sector is an exception where purpose codes are
  hierarchically structured.   It is not possible to track directly the
  destination or purpose of UK funding to the general core budgets of the
  multilateral organisations. However a good indication of where UK funding goes
  is provided by OECD DAC data where the multilaterals report aid spend by
  country and sector. Therefore the multilateral data are estimates which have
  been calculated on the basis of the UK's share of the multilaterals' reported
  aid spending to the OECD.  The OECD data cover most of the main multilaterals
  the UK funds.  About 15% of the UK's core multilateral funding is not covered
  by the OECD data, and this unreported spending is allocated to the developing
  countries unspecified category.   More details on the estimates' quality are
  found in the Imputed multilateral share quality report (Statistics on
  International Development 2016).
computation_disaggregation: >-
  This data can be disaggregated by Flow of Aid (Bilateral/Multilateral), Aid
  Description (CRS Code), Recipient Region and Country, and Type of Aid (e.g.
  Debt relief [F01], Scholarships/training in donor country [E01], etc.). Flow
  of Aid (Bilateral/Multilateral) can be disaggregated by other disaggregation.

computation_calculations: >-
  The raw data underlying the United Kingdom Statistics on International
  Development was summed around appropriate aid description CRS codes, bilateral
  and multilateral classification, donor recipient countries, and type of aid
  codes.

  Bilateral Aid: Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when
  the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes
  aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the
  government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds
  will be spent on.

  Multilateral Aid: This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to
  organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations.

  Purpose Codes: The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat
  maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid
  flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify
  information in the DAC databases. The sector classification codes used can be
  found on the OECD website
  (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm).
