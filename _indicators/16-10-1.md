indicator_name: Number of verified cases of killing, kidnapping, enforced disappearance,
  arbitrary detention and torture of journalists, associated media personnel, trade
  unionists and human rights advocates in the previous 12 months
target: Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance
  with national legislation and international agreements.
indicator_definition: For this indicator, killing includes intentional homicide and
  other arbitrary deprivation of life, as formulated in Article 6(1) ICCPR. Enforced
  disappearance is defined as the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of
  deprivation of liberty, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of
  liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person,
  which place such a person outside the protection of the law (International Convention
  for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, adapted to account
  for disappearances perpetrated by non-State actors). Arbitrary detention is detention
  without due process and safeguards, as outlined in Article 9(1) ICCPR. Torture means
  any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally
  inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person
  information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed
  or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third
  person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or
  suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence
  of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity (Convention
  against Torture). Assault means physical attack against the body of another person
  resulting in serious bodily injury. Human rights defenders is a term used to describe
  people who, individually or with others, act to promote or protect human rights.
  Human rights defenders are identified above all by what they do and it is through
  a description of their actions and of some of the contexts in which they work that
  the term can best be explained. The definition of human rights defenders may include
  journalists and trade unionists, but each individual case is counted only once.
  Other examples may include a student campaigning to end torture in prisons, a politician
  who takes a stand against endemic corruption or witnesses in court cases on human
  rights abuses. Journalists cover 'journalists, media workers and social media producers
  who generate a significant amount of public-interest journalism.' This concepualisation,
  has been agreed by UNESCO Member States, and could include a wide range of actors,
  including professional full-time reporters and analysts, foreign correspondents
  and local journalists, as well as bloggers and other social media producers who
  engage in forms of self-publication in print, on the Internet or elsewhere, journalists
  from 'traditional media' and those who work across multiple media. The term "trade
  unionist" refers to an individual employed or accredited by a trade union, and other
  elected representatives of workers, including workers in the informal sector. The
  indicator is calculated as the total number of reported cases of killing, disappearance,
  arbitrary detention, assault and torture of journalists, trade unionists or human
  rights defenders during the reporting period which are verified by an independent
  entity (in this case OHCHR and UNESCO).
