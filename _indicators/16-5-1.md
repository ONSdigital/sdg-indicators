rationale_interpretation: 'Corruption is an antonym of equal accessibility to public services and of correct functioning of the economy; as such, it has a negative impact on fair distribution of resources and development opportunities. Besides, corruption erodes public trust in authorities and the rule of law; when administrative bribery becomes a recurrent experience of large sectors of the population and businesses, its negative effects have an enduring negative impact on democratic processes and justice. By providing a direct measure of the experience of bribery, this indicator provides an objective metrics of corruption, a yardstick to monitor progress in the fight against corruption.'

indicator_definition: 'Percentage of persons who paid at least one bribe (gave a public official money, a gift or counter favour) or were asked for a bribe by these public officials, to a public official in the last 12 months, as a percentage of persons who had at least one contact with a public official in the same period. Bribery is the undue advantage (money, gift or a service) requested/offered by/to a public official in exchange for a special treatment. Administrative bribery is often intended as the type of bribery affecting citizens or businesses in their dealings with public administrations and/or civil servants: this form of bribery affects most countries of the world and can be measured through sample surveys that focus on the experience of bribery.'
