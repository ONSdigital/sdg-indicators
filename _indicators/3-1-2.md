computation_units: Percentage (%)
computation_definitions: >-
  Percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel (generally doctors, nurses or midwives) is the percentage of deliveries attended by health personnel trained in providing lifesaving obstetric care, including giving the necessary supervision, care and advice to women during pregnancy, labour and the post-partum period, conducting deliveries on their own, and caring for newborns. Traditional birth attendants, even if they receive a short training course, are not included. A maternity is a pregnancy resulting in the birth of one or more children including stillbirths. A stillbirth is a baby born after 24 or more weeks completed gestation and which did not, at any time, breathe or show signs of life.
computation_calculations: >-
  The percentage of women giving birth can be calculated by adding the number of maternities in NHS hospitals to the number of maternities in non-NHS hospitals. The number of maternities in NHS and non-NHS hospitals divided by the total number of maternities, multiplied by 100.
computation_numerator: Number of maternities in a medical facility

computation_denominator: Number of births, including stillbirths

computation_disaggregation: >-
  The data can be disaggregated by Age Categories (under 20, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35 to 39, 40 to 44, 45 and over) and Geography (England and Wales, regions of England, health boards in Wales ).
comments_limitations: >-
  Maternities in medical facilities used as a proxy.  NHS medical facilities – generally hospitals, maternity units and maternity wings.  Non-NHS medical facilities – including private maternity units, military hospitals, private hospitals and communal establishments.
