computation_units: Percentage (%)
computation_definitions: >-
  Percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel (generally doctors,
  nurses or midwives) is the percentage of deliveries attended by health
  personnel trained in providing lifesaving obstetric care, including giving the
  necessary supervision, care and advice to women during pregnancy, labour and
  the post-partum period, conducting deliveries on their own, and caring for
  newborns. Traditional birth attendants, even if they receive a short training
  course, are not included. A maternity is a pregnancy resulting in the birth of
  one or more children including stillbirths. A stillbirth is a baby born after
  24 or more weeks completed gestation and which did not, at any time, breathe
  or show signs of life.
computation_calculations: >-
  The percentage of women giving birth can be calculated by adding the number of
  maternities in NHS hospitals to the number of maternities in non-NHS
  hospitals. The number of maternities in NHS and non-NHS hospitals divided by
  the total number of maternities, multiplied by 100.
computation_numerator: Number of maternities in a medical facility
computation_denominator: 'Number of births, including stillbirths'
computation_disaggregation: >-
  The data can be disaggregated by Age Categories (under 20, 20 to 24, 25 to 29,
  30 to 34, 35 to 39, 40 to 44, 45 and over) and Geography (England and Wales,
  regions of England, health boards in Wales ).
comments_limitations: >-
  Maternities in medical facilities used as a proxy.  NHS medical facilities –
  generally hospitals, maternity units and maternity wings.  Non-NHS medical
  facilities – including private maternity units, military hospitals, private
  hospitals and communal establishments.
