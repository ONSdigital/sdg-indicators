method_of_computation: "Number of births attended by skilled health personnel (doctors, nurses or midwives) trained in providing life_saving obstetric care, including giving the necessary supervision, care and advice to women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period, to conduct deliveries on their own, and to care for newborns / The total number of live births in the same period Method of measurement  Definition of skilled birth attendant varies between countries. The percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel is calculated as the number of births attended by skilled health personnel (doctors, nurses or midwives) expressed as a percentage of the total number of births in the same period. Births attended by skilled health personnel = (number of births attended by skilled health personnel)/(total number of live births) x 100. In household surveys, such as DHS, MICS and RHS, the respondent is asked about each live birth and who helped during delivery for a period up to five years before the interview.'' Service/facility records could be used where a high proportion of births occur in health facilities and are therefore recorded. Method of estimation Data for global monitoring are reported by UNICEF and WHO. These agencies obtain the data - both survey and registry data ' from national sources. Before data can be included in the global databases, UNICEF and WHO undertake a process of data verification that includes correspondence with field offices to clarify any questions. In terms of survey data, some survey reports may present a total percentage of births attended by a type of provider that does not conform to the MDG definition (e.g. total includes providers who are not considered skilled, such as community health workers). In this case, the percentage delivered by a physician, nurse or midwife are totalled and entered into the global database as the MDG estimate.'' Predominant type of statistics: adjusted"
