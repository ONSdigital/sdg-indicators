indicator_name: Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel
target: >-
  By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per
  100,000 live births.
indicator_definition: >-
  Percentage of live births attended by skilled health personnel during a
  specified time period.
method_of_computation: >-
  Number of births attended by skilled health personnel (doctors, nurses or
  midwives) trained in providing life_saving obstetric care, including giving
  the necessary supervision, care and advice to women during pregnancy,
  childbirth and the postpartum period, to conduct deliveries on their own, and
  to care for newborns / The total number of live births in the same period
  Method of measurement  Definition of skilled birth attendant varies between
  countries. The percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel is
  calculated as the number of births attended by skilled health personnel
  (doctors, nurses or midwives) expressed as a percentage of the total number of
  births in the same period. Births attended by skilled health personnel =
  (number of births attended by skilled health personnel)/(total number of live
  births) x 100. In household surveys, such as DHS, MICS and RHS, the respondent
  is asked about each live birth and who helped during delivery for a period up
  to five years before the interview.'' Service/facility records could be used
  where a high proportion of births occur in health facilities and are therefore
  recorded. Method of estimation Data for global monitoring are reported by
  UNICEF and WHO. These agencies obtain the data - both survey and registry data
  ' from national sources. Before data can be included in the global databases,
  UNICEF and WHO undertake a process of data verification that includes
  correspondence with field offices to clarify any questions. In terms of survey
  data, some survey reports may present a total percentage of births attended by
  a type of provider that does not conform to the MDG definition (e.g. total
  includes providers who are not considered skilled, such as community health
  workers). In this case, the percentage delivered by a physician, nurse or
  midwife are totalled and entered into the global database as the MDG
  estimate.'' Predominant type of statistics: adjusted
