rationale_interpretation: "From Goal 16 TST Working Group:\nIn order that decision-making be responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative, it is important to ensure diversity in representation at all levels of State institutions (central, regional and local). \nArticle 25(c) ICCPR provides that citizens should have access, on general terms of equality, to public service in their country. General Comment 25 of the Human Rights Committee elaborates that access to public service should be based on equal opportunity and general principles of merit, and further states that the provision of secured tenure would ensure that persons holding public service positions are free from political interference or pressures. \nArticle 7(c) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) stipulates that States should take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the political and public life of the country and, in particular, ensure to women, on equal terms with men, the right to participate in the formulation of government policy and the implementation thereof and to hold public office and perform all public functions at all levels of government.\n\n From OHCHR: \nIn order that decision-making be responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative, it is important to ensure diversity in representation at all levels of State institutions (central, regional and local). \nArticle 25(c) ICCPR provides that citizens should have access, on general terms of equality, to public service in their country.

In some circumstances, such as linguistic minorities, ensuring access to public services for the group may require over-representation of that group in public service posts."

indicator_name: 'Proportions of positions (by sex, age, persons with disabilities and population groups) in public institutions (national and local legislatures, public service, and judiciary) compared to national distributions'
target: 'Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels.'
indicator_definition: 'From Goal 16 TST Working Group:This indicator focuses on the representativeness aspect of the target, but the presence of diversity also conduces to inclusivity and responsiveness of decision-making. The indicator is calculated as the number of public service positions held by members of the target group divided by the total number of such positions. From OHCHR: Target groups should be identified at national level in an inclusive, participatory process, with the direct involvement of marginalised and minority groups themselves. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) has made clear that identification as a member of a particular ethnic group ''shall, if no justification exists to the contrary, be based upon self-identification by the individual concerned.'' This principle also applies to other population groups. Target groups may include persons with disabilities, ethnic groups, LGBTI persons, indigenous peoples, religious minorities, linguistic minorities, youth, older persons, or other groups under-represented in the national context. The indicator is calculated as the number of public service positions held by members of the target group divided by the total number of such positions.'
