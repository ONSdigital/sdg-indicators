indicator_name: Proportions of positions (by sex, age, persons with disabilities and
  population groups) in public institutions (national and local legislatures, public
  service, and judiciary) compared to national distributions
target: Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making
  at all levels.
indicator_definition: 'From Goal 16 TST Working Group:This indicator focuses on the
  representativeness aspect of the target, but the presence of diversity also conduces
  to inclusivity and responsiveness of decision-making. The indicator is calculated
  as the number of public service positions held by members of the target group divided
  by the total number of such positions. From OHCHR: Target groups should be identified
  at national level in an inclusive, participatory process, with the direct involvement
  of marginalised and minority groups themselves. The Committee on the Elimination
  of Racial Discrimination (CERD) has made clear that identification as a member of
  a particular ethnic group ''shall, if no justification exists to the contrary, be
  based upon self-identification by the individual concerned.'' This principle also
  applies to other population groups. Target groups may include persons with disabilities,
  ethnic groups, LGBTI persons, indigenous peoples, religious minorities, linguistic
  minorities, youth, older persons, or other groups under-represented in the national
  context. The indicator is calculated as the number of public service positions held
  by members of the target group divided by the total number of such positions.'
