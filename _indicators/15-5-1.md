target: Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats,
  halt the loss of biodiversity, and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction
  of threatened species.
indicator_definition: Definition The Red List Index is a multi-purpose indicator which
  measures the aggregate change in extinction risk across groups of species. It is
  based on the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red
  List of Threatened Species. This indicator is expressed as an index ranging from
  0 to 1. Concepts Threatened species are those listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened
  Species in the categories Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered (i.e.,
  species that are facing a high, very high, or extremely high risk of extinction
  in the wild in the medium-term future). Changes over time in the proportion of species
  threatened with extinction are largely driven by improvements in knowledge and changing
  taxonomy. The IUCN Red List Index (RLI) therefore accounts for such changes to yield
  a more informative indicator than the simple proportion of threatened species. It
  measures change in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species over time,
  resulting from genuine improvements or deteriorations in the status of individual
  species. It can be calculated for any representative set of species that have been
  assessed for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species at least twice.
