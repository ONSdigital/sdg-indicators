method_of_computation: "Number of malaria cases / Population at risk (number of people living in areas where malaria transmission occurs) Method of measurement Complete data on malaria cases reported through surveillance systems are the best source of data but are rarely available for large populations. Reported data on malaria cases generally need to be corrected for extent of health service use, incompleteness of reporting and lack of case confirmation. In high transmission areas with limited health service data but with good data on parasite prevalence the number of cases can be estimated from parasite prevalence.''The denominator is estimated, using risk mapping and population data. Method of estimation WHO compiles data on reported confirmed cases of malaria, submitted by national malaria control programmes and estimates the extent of underreporting.''Where necessary the number of cases are inferred from parasite prevalence surveys.''"
