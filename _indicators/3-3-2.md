  Number of new and relapse TB cases arising in a specified time period / Number
  of person_years of exposure Method of measurement Direct measurement requires
  high_quality surveillance systems in which underreporting is negligible, and
  strong health systems so that underdiagnosis is also negligible; otherwise
  indirect estimates based on notification data and estimates of levels of
  underreporting and under_diagnosis. Method of estimation Estimates of TB
  incidence are produced through a consultative and analytical process led by
  WHO and are published annually. These estimates are based on annual case
  notifications, assessments of the quality and coverage of TB notification
  data, national surveys of the prevalence of TB disease and information from
  death (vital) registration systems.'' Estimates of incidence for each country
  are derived, using one or more of the following approaches depending on
  available data: (i) incidence = case notifications/estimated proportion of
  cases detected; (ii) incidence = prevalence/duration of condition; (iii)
  incidence = deaths/proportion of incident cases that die. Uncertainty bounds
  are provided in addition to best estimates. Details are available from TB
  impact measurement: policy and recommendations for how to assess the
  epidemiological burden of TB and the impact of TB control and from the online
  technical appendix to the WHO global tuberculosis report 2014.
indicator_definition: >-
  Estimated number of new and relapse TB cases (all forms of TB, including cases
  in people living with HIV) arising in a given year, expressed as a rate per
  100 000 population.
target: >-
  By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected
  tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other
  communicable diseases.
