  Grounds of discrimination prohibited under international human rights law, as
  enshrined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequently
  elaborated upon by international human rights mechanisms, include ethnicity,
  sex, age, income, geographic location, disability, religion, migratory or
  displacement status, civil status, sexual orientation and gender identity. In
  the United Kingdom, hate crime is defined as ‘any criminal offence which is
  perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or
  prejudice towards someone based on a personal characteristic.’ This common
  definition was agreed in 2007 by the police, Crown Prosecution Service, Prison
  Service (now the National Offender Management Service) and other agencies that
  make up the criminal justice system. There are five centrally monitored
  strands of hate crime: race or ethnicity; religion or beliefs; sexual
  orientation; disability; and transgender identity. In the process of recording
  a crime, police can flag an offence as being motivated by one or more of the
  five monitored strands listed above (for example, an offence can be motivated
  by hostility towards the victim’s race and religion). Figures presented have
  been calculated from the total number of motivating factors. For further

  "Data for England and Wales includes hate crimes recorded by the Britsh
  Transport Police. Data may include multiple hate crime strands being assigned
  to an offence.  An offence may be motivated by hatred towards a characteristic
  (strand) that is not centrally monitored and therefore would not be
  represented in this data (age or gender for example). Operationally, such an
  offence could still be investigated as a hate crime by the police. For further
  information please see College of Policing, Hate Crime, Operational Guidance @
  http://www.report-it.org.uk/files/hate_crime_operational_guidance.pdf"
