  This is a dichotomous variable. In the US, several national laws providing
  this coverage are relevant. For coding purposes, we consider three most
  relevant: the Paperwork Reduction Act, which gives authority to the
  Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to designate
  a Chief Statistician with professional credentials and to designate the
  responsibility of ensuring official national statistics reflect relevance,
  accuracy, and objectivity. The Confidential Information Protection and
  Statistical Efficiency Act protects the confidentialty of infomration provided
  for solely statistical purposes. The Information Quality Act ensures that the
  quality of infomration collected is commesurate with its intended use and
  provides a means for the public to challenge (and thereby ensure) the quality
  of information collected.
