  The provision of unpaid care and domestic work has a profound implication on
  our understanding of poverty and well-being. As a result of their socially
  ascribed roles, women and girls do the bulk of unpaid care and domestic work,
  which includes household maintenance activities such as cooking and cleaning
  as well as person-toperson care activities such as child and elder care. [2] 

  Producing time use statistics thus contributes to increasing the visibility of
  women's work through better statistics on their contribution to the economy '
  with particular emphasis on the value of goods and services they produce. [1]
