indicator_name: Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint
  per GDP
target: By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources.
indicator_definition: Material footprint (MF) is the attribution of global material
  extraction to domestic final demand of a country. It is calculated as raw material
  equivalent of imports (RMEIM) plus domestic extraction (DE) minus raw material equivalents
  of exports (RMEEX). For the attribution of the primary material needs of final demand
  a global, multi-regional input-output (MRIO) framework is employed. The attribution
  method based on I-O analytical tools is described in detail in Wiedmann et al. 2015.
  It is based on the EORA MRIO framework developed by the University of Sydney, Australia
  (Lenzen et al. 2013) which is an internationally well-established and the most detailed
  and reliable MRIO framework available to date.
