  The gender wage gap measures the extent to which the wages of men differ from
  those of women and therefore directly addresses the target of "equal pay for
  work of equal value". When the gender pay gap equals "0", it denotes equality
  of earnings. Positive values reflect the extent to which women's earnings fall
  short of those received by men, where a value closer to "100" denotes more
  inequality than a value closer to "0". Negative values reflect the extent to
  which women's earnings are higher than men's.

indicator_definition: >-
  The gender wage gap measures the relative difference between the average
  hourly earnings for men and the average hourly earnings for women. It is
  computed as the difference between the gross average hourly earnings of male
  and female employees expressed as percentage of gross average hourly earnings
  of male employees. Earnings refers to regular remuneration received from
  employers, in cash and in kind, and includes direct wages and salaries for
  time worked or work done, remuneration for time not worked (e.g. paid annual
  leave), as well as bonuses and gratuities that are regularly received. It
  excludes contributions paid by employers to social security and pension
  schemes in respect of their employees, benefits received by employees under
  these schemes, and severance and termination pay.
