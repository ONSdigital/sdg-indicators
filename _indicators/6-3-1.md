rationale_interpretation: "SDG proposed target calls for reducing water pollution, minimizing release of hazardous chemical and increasing treatment and reuse. Household wastewater includes faecal waste from onsite facilities (such as emptying and cleaning of cesspools and septic tanks, sinks and pits) as well as off-site wastewater treatment plants according to the ISIC definition 3700 for \"Sewerage\". Inclusion of onsite facilities is critical from a public health, environment and equity perspective since approximately two thirds people globally use on-site facilities. \nIndustrial wastewater (which includes point source agricultural discharges) responds to minimizing release of hazardous chemicals. Diffuse agricultural pollution is a major source of water pollution but cannot be monitored at source and therefore its impact on ambient water quality will be monitored under 6.3.2."

indicator_name: 'Proportion of wastewater safely treated'
target: 'By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.'
indicator_definition: 'Proportion of wastewater generated both by households (sewage and faecal sludge), as well as economic activities (based on ISIC categories) safely treated compared to total wastewater generated both through households and economic activities. While the definition conceptually includes wastewater generated from all economic activities, monitoring will focus on wastewater generated from hazardous industries (as defined by relevant ISIC categories).'

method_of_computation: 'The wastewater safely treated is calculated by combining the percentage of household (sewage and faecal sludge) wastewater and the percentage of wastewater from hazardous industries treated. Household surveys and censuses provide information on use of types of basic sanitation facilities. These estimates are combined with safety factors for on-site disposal and for transportation to designated places for safe disposal or treatment, as described in indicator 6.2.1. The information generated for indicator 6.2.1 will be combined with safety factors describing the proportion of wastewater from hazardous industries which is safely treated before disposal or reuse to produce indicator 6.3.1. Calculation of safety factors for household wastewater (sewage and faecal sludge) treatment will be coordinated with estimation of similar safety factors for safe management of sanitation required for indicator 6.2.1. The accompanying Statistical Note describes in more detail how ''safety factors'' for wastewater treatment, disposal and reuse will be generated through a national assessment process, and combined with data on use of different types of sanitation facilities, as recorded in the current JMP database. Statistical methods for measurement of the wastewater treatment (called "wastewater to sewerage"by SEEA-Water) align with the SEEA definitions and treatment categories (primary, secondary, tertiary). Statistical methods for the treatment of industrial wastewater align with the SEEA definitions and treatment categories using ISIC classifications and treated volumes from permits data.'
