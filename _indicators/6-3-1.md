indicator_name: Proportion of wastewater safely treated
target: By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping
  and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion
  of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally
indicator_definition: Proportion of wastewater generated both by households (sewage
  and faecal sludge), as well as economic activities (based on ISIC categories) safely
  treated compared to total wastewater generated both through households and economic
  activities. While the definition conceptually includes wastewater generated from
  all economic activities, monitoring will focus on wastewater generated from hazardous
  industries (as defined by relevant ISIC categories).
