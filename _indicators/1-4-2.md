indicator_name: Proportion of total adult population with secure tenure rights to
  land, with legally recognized documentation and who perceive their rights to land
  as secure, by sex and by type of tenure
target: By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable,
  have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership
  and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources,
  appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance.
indicator_definition: "Land Tenure Land tenure can be described as a bundle of rights
  that individuals and communities have with regard to land, which may include the
  rights to occupy, to use, to develop, to inherit, and to transfer land. Some of
  these rights will be held by individuals, some by groups, and others by political
  entities. This bundle of rights can be broken up, rearranged and passed on to others.
  The following is the typology: Secure tenure rights or tenure security Tenure security
  is the right of individuals and groups to effective protection by the state against
  evictions, i.e. under international law, \"the permanent or temporary removal against
  their will of individuals, families and/communities from the home and/or the land
  they occupy, without the provision of, and access to, appropriate form of legal
  or other protection\". Security of tenure can then be defined as \"an agreement
  between an individual or group about land and residential property, which is governed
  and regulated by a legal and administrative framework. A person or household can
  be said to have secure tenure when they are protected from involuntary removal from
  their land or residence by the state, except in exceptional circumstances, and then
  only by means of a known and agreed legal procedure, which must itself be objective,
  equally applicable, contestable and independent.\" Perceived tenure security refers
  to an individual's experience of his/her tenure situation or their estimated probability
  that their land rights will not be lost as a result of eviction by the state, land
  owner or other authority, or because of other factors that may cause involuntary
  relocation or curtail their use of the land, such as threats of land conflicts.
  Characterizing tenure status is based on four sets of interrelated parameters: \t1.
  Primary tenure rights on land \t2. Land tenure (rights of occupants on the land)
  \t3. Occupancy status (of the dwelling unit) \t4. Type of development Legal tenure
  security refers to the legal status of tenure and its protection backed up by state
  authority. De facto tenure security is based on the actual control of property,
  regardless of the legal status in which it is held. It can best be defined by the
  elements that compose it or contribute to it, such as the length of time of occupation,
  its socially accepted legitimacy and the level and cohesion of community organization.
  UNFAO (2003) defines Communally held land is where rights to use resources are held
  by a community. It refers to situations where rights to use resources are held and
  controlled by a community. While these rights may include communal rights to pastures
  and forests, they may also include exclusive private rights to agricultural land
  and residential plots. Local Communities A group of individuals belonging to the
  same community residing within or in the same vicinity of a particular parcel, property
  or natural resource. The community members are co-owners that share exclusive rights
  and duties, and benefits contribute to the community development. Indigenous land
  rights Indigenous land rights are rights specific to a particular ethnic group,
  having evolved through interaction of culture and environment and overseen by authorities
  whose legitimacy is based on occupation and spiritual ties to the locality. Community
  land rights Community land rights are collective rights of land ownership, access
  or use held or exercised in common by members of a community. A community may be
  designated as a village-based or more geographically dispersed community, or a clan
  or a lineage. Collective rights A situation where holders of land rights are clearly
  defined as a group and have the right to exclude others from the enjoyment of those
  land rights. Collective ownership of a natural resource refers to a situation where
  the holders of rights to a given natural resource are clearly defined as a collective
  group, and where they have the right to exclude third parties from the enjoyment
  of those rights. Common property Common property refers to situations in which entitled
  beneficiaries hold specified rights in common to specific areas of land, land-based
  natural resources or other types of property. Property / private property Property
  signifies dominion or right of use, control and disposition, which one may lawfully
  exercise over things, objects or land. Property rights Property rights refer to
  \"a bundle of rights to use, control, and transfer assets, including land. These
  include the rights to occupy, enjoy and use; to restrict others from entry or use;
  to dispose, buy or inherit; to develop or improve; to cultivate; to sublet; to realize
  financial benefits; and to access services in association with land. Open access
  resources Resources ' including land ' to which everyone has unrestricted access
  and that are not considered to be the property of anyone. Ecosystem services: Ecosystem
  services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. These include provisioning,
  regulating, and cultural services that directly affect people and supporting services
  needed to maintain the other services. Natural resources: The term 'natural resources'
  refers to oil, minerals, forests, water, and fertile land that occur in nature and
  can be exploited for economic gain."
