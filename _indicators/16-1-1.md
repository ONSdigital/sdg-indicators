indicator_name: Number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population,
  by sex and age
target: Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere.
indicator_definition: "From UNODC:Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful
  death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause death or serious injury (Source:
  International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, ICCS 2015); the
  rate is defined as the total count of victims of intentional homicide divided by
  the total resident population, expressed per 100,000 population. From Goal 16 TST
  Working Group:  This indicator is a composite indicator constructed by collecting
  two numbers, deaths from intentional homicides and deaths from conflict to measure
  \"peace\" with respect to target 1 ' \"Significantly reduce all forms of violence
  and related deaths everywhere.\" The rates of intentional homicide and conflict-related
  deaths should be reported separately, as combining them into one single indicator
  would risk conflating two distinct phenomena with differing root causes as well
  as varying levels of precision in measurement. Still, they are useful complements
  to each other as, by construction, they are exclusive and non-overlapping (ie. By
  design, their conjunction does not double count violent deaths). Intentional homicide
  is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent of cause
  death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical
  Purposes (ICCS), 2015). ICCS recommends that intentional homicides include: \tMurder
  \tHonour killing \tSerious assault leading to death \tDeath as a result of terrorist
  activities \tDowry-related killings \tFemicide \tInfanticide \tVoluntary manslaughter
  \tExtrajudicial killings \tKillings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state
  officials Conflict-related deaths refer to those deaths caused by warring parties,
  including, but not limited to, those caused by traditional battlefield fighting
  and bombardments (battle-related deaths). The term conflict-related death is broader
  than the term \"battlerelated death\" as it includes killings that amount to war
  crimes, such as targeting of civilians or of military 'hors combat', killings associated
  with a conflict (but not accompanied by a battle between warring parties) such as
  one-sided killings, pogroms and genocides. Following the ICCS definition (see homicides
  at left) death as a result of terrorist activities would be included in intentional
  homicides. For both intentional homicides and conflict-related deaths, rates are
  defined as the total count in deaths in a calendar year, respectively, divided by
  the total resident population for the year, expressed per 100,000 population. The
  denominator (100,000 population) has been adopted globally by law enforcement as
  the standard for comparable measurement."
