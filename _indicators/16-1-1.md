  From UNODC:

  This indicator is widely used at national and international level to measure
  the most extreme form of violent crime and it also provides a direct
  indication of lack of security. Security from violence is a pre-requisite for
  individuals to enjoy a safe and active life and for societies and economies to
  develop freely. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and
  this indicator has a global applicability. Monitoring intentional homicides is
  necessary to better assess their causes, drivers and consequences and, in the
  longer term, to develop effective preventive measures. 

  If data are properly disaggregated (as suggested in the ICCS), the indicator
  can identify the different type of violence associated with homicide:
  inter-personal (including partner and family-related violence), crime
  (including organized crime and other forms of criminal activities) and
  political (including terrorism, hate crime). 

  The interpretation of this indicator is straightforward also for
  non-specialised users.

   From Goal 16 TST Working Group: 
   As described above, this composite indicator is comprised of two forms of violent deaths. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and have global applicability, while conflict-related deaths occur in countries with ongoing conflicts/wars. Peace is a much broader concept than violent deaths, however, it is difficult to measure many aspects of peace (threats and the fear of violence, insecurity, and other forms of violence, including damages to persons and property). Deaths due to violence are universally and easily understood, are frequently monitored and are comparable with only minor discrepancies in interpretation, largely due to the finality of death. Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective prevention measures. It is based on statistical data routinely produced by law enforcement authorities and/or public health institutions, with a high degree of international comparability. Conflict-related deaths measure the direct impact of conflicts on populations in terms of losses of life.

  Number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population, by sex and
  age
target: Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere.
indicator_definition: "From UNODC:Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, ICCS 2015); the rate is defined as the total count of victims of intentional homicide divided by the total resident population, expressed per 100,000 population. From Goal 16 TST Working Group:  This indicator is a composite indicator constructed by collecting two numbers, deaths from intentional homicides and deaths from conflict to measure \"peace\" with respect to target 1 ' \"Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related deaths everywhere.\" The rates of intentional homicide and conflict-related deaths should be reported separately, as combining them into one single indicator would risk conflating two distinct phenomena with differing root causes as well as varying levels of precision in measurement. Still, they are useful complements to each other as, by construction, they are exclusive and non-overlapping (ie. By design, their conjunction does not double count violent deaths). Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent of cause death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS), 2015). ICCS recommends that intentional homicides include: \tMurder \tHonour killing \tSerious assault leading to death \tDeath as a result of terrorist activities \tDowry-related killings \tFemicide \tInfanticide \tVoluntary manslaughter \tExtrajudicial killings \tKillings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officials Conflict-related deaths refer to those deaths caused by warring parties, including, but not limited to, those caused by traditional battlefield fighting and bombardments (battle-related deaths). The term conflict-related death is broader than the term \"battlerelated death\" as it includes killings that amount to war crimes, such as targeting of civilians or of military 'hors combat', killings associated with a conflict (but not accompanied by a battle between warring parties) such as one-sided killings, pogroms and genocides. Following the ICCS definition (see homicides at left) death as a result of terrorist activities would be included in intentional homicides. For both intentional homicides and conflict-related deaths, rates are defined as the total count in deaths in a calendar year, respectively, divided by the total resident population for the year, expressed per 100,000 population. The denominator (100,000 population) has been adopted globally by law enforcement as the standard for comparable measurement."

  These tables contain statistics for the entire United States. Because not all
  law enforcement agencies provide data for complete reporting periods, the FBI
  estimated crime numbers in these presentations. The FBI computes estimates for
  participating agencies that do not provide 12 months of complete data. For
  agencies supplying 3 to 11 months of data, the national UCR Program estimates
  for the missing data by following a standard estimation procedure using the
  data provided by the agency. If an agency has supplied less than 3 months of
  data, the FBI computes estimates by using the known crime figures of similar
  areas within a state and assigning the same proportion of crime volumes to
  nonreporting agencies. The estimation process considers the following:
  population size covered by the agency; type of jurisdiction, e.g., police
  department versus sheriff’s office; and geographic location. Much of the data
  presented in the Crime in the United States publication are obtained from the
  Monthly Return of Offenses Known to Police form which is required to
  participate in the FBI UCR Program.  Data sited from the FBI UCR Program’s
  website regarding the age and sex of a victim of homicide is obtained from the
  Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR).  The SHR provides additional details
  surrounding the homicide such as victim and offender age, sex, and race, type
  of weapon, circumstance during a homicide, and the relationship of the victim
  to the offender.  The SHR is not required for participation in the program.
  Murder victims with unknown age and/or sex are not included in this table. To
  calculate the estimated number of males, females, and age of the victim, the
  percent distribution was figured using data supplied to the national UCR
  Program on the SHR.  The resulting figure was then applied to the total
  estimated number of homicides for the nation.  The homicide rate, defined as
  the number of offenses per 100,000 population, is derived by first dividing
  the nation’s population by 100,000 and then dividing the number of offenses by
  the resulting figure.
