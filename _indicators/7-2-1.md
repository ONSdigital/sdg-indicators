  The target "By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in
  the global energy mix" impacts all three dimensions of sustainable
  development. Renewable energy technologies represent a major element in
  strategies for greening economies everywhere in the world and for tackling the
  critical global problem of climate change. A number of definitions of
  renewable energy exist; what they have in common is highlighting as renewable
  all forms of energy that their consumption does not deplete their availability
  in the future. These include solar, wind, ocean, hydropower, geothermal
  resources, and bioenergy (in the case of bioenergy, which can be depleted,
  sources of bioenergy can be replaced within a short to medium-term frame).
  Importantly, this indicator focuses on the amount of renewable energy actually
  consumed rather than the capacity for renewable energy production, which
  cannot always be fully utilized. By focusing on consumption by the end user,
  it avoids the distortions caused by the fact that conventional energy sources
  are subject to significant energy losses along the production chain.
