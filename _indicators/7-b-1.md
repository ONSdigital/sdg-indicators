  Indicator 7.b.1 is in two parts. Part 1 of the indicator (Investments in
  energy efficiency as a proportion of GDP...) is currently displaying, and we
  are in the process of sourcing Part 2 (...the amount of foreign direct
  investment in financial transfer for infrastructure and technology to
  sustainable development services). FDI data disaggregated by sustainability
  development services (or similar) are not currently available, and UN Stat
  recommend further reflections on definition to inform data acquisition for
  this indicator.  UN Stat link -
