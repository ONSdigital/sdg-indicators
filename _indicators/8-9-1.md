  Tourism Direct GDP (TDGDP) is defined as the sum of the part of gross value
  added (at basic prices) generated by all industries in response to internal
  tourism consumption plus the amount of net taxes on products and imports
  included within the value of this expenditure at purchasers' prices (TSA: RMF
  2008 para. 4.96). Presenting this economic contribution of tourism as a share
  of GDP shows the relative size of the tourism sector in the economy.
