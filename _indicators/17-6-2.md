indicator_name: Fixed Internet broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, by speed
target: Enhance North-South, South-South and triangular regional and international
  cooperation on and access to science, technology and innovation and enhance knowledge
  sharing on mutually agreed terms, including through improved coordination among
  existing mechanisms, in particular at the United Nations level, and through a global
  technology facilitation mechanism.
indicator_definition: "The indicator fixed Internet broadband subscriptions, by speed,
  refers to the number of fixed broadband subscriptions to the public Internet, split
  by advertised download speed. Fixed Internet broadband subscriptions refer to subscriptions
  to high-speed access to the public Internet (a TCP/IP connection), at downstream
  speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s. This includes cable modem, DSL, fibre-to-the-home/building,
  other fixed (wired)- broadband subscriptions, satellite broadband and terrestrial
  fixed wireless broadband. This total is measured irrespective of the method of payment.
  It excludes subscriptions that have access to data communications (including the
  Internet) via mobile-cellular networks. It should include fixed WiMAX and any other
  fixed wireless technologies. It includes both residential subscriptions and subscriptions
  for organizations. The Internet is a worldwide public computer network. It provides
  access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries
  e-mail, news, entertainment and data files. The indicator is currently broken down
  by the following subscription speeds: \t256 kbit/s to less than 2 Mbit/s subscriptions:
  Refers to all fixed broadband Internet subscriptions with advertised downstream
  speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s and less than 2 Mbit/s. \t2 Mbit/s
  to less than 10 Mbit/s subscriptions: Refers to all fixed -broadband Internet subscriptions
  with advertised downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 2 Mbit/s and less than
  10 Mbit/s. \tEqual to or above 10 Mbit/s subscriptions (4213_G10). Refers to all
  fixed - broadband Internet subscriptions with advertised downstream speeds equal
  to, or greater than, 10 Mbit/s. ITU collects data for this indicator through an
  annual questionnaire from national regulatory authorities or Information and Communication
  Technology (ICT) Ministries, who collect the data from national Internet service
  providers. The data can be collected by asking each Internet service provider in
  the country to provide the number of their fixed-broadband subscriptions by the
  speeds indicated. The data are then added up to obtain the country totals."
