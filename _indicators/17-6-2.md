  The Internet has become an increasingly important tool to provide access to
  information, and can help foster and enhance regional and international
  cooperation on, and access to, science, technology and innovations, and
  enhance knowledge sharing. High-speed Internet access is important to ensure
  that Internet users have quality access to the Internet and can take advantage
  of the growing amount of Internet content ' including user-generated content
  ', services and information. 

  While the number of fixed-broadband subscriptions has increased substantially
  over the last years and while service providers offer increasingly higher
  speeds, fixed Internet broadband can vary tremendously by speed, thus
  affecting the quality and functionality of Internet access. Many countries,
  especially in the developing world, have not only a very limited amount of
  fixed-broadband subscriptions, but also at very low speeds. This limitation is
  a barrier to the Target 17.6 and the indicator highlights the potential of the
  Internet (especially through high-speed access) to enhance cooperation,
  improve access to science, technology and innovation, and share knowledge. The
  indicator also highlights the importance of Internet use as a development
  enabler and helps to measure the digital divide, which, if not properly
  addressed, will aggravate inequalities in all development domains. Information
  on fixed broadband subscriptions by speed will contribute to the design of
  targeted policies to overcome those divides.

target: >-
  Enhance North-South, South-South and triangular regional and international
  cooperation on and access to science, technology and innovation and enhance
  knowledge sharing on mutually agreed terms, including through improved
  coordination among existing mechanisms, in particular at the United Nations
  level, and through a global technology facilitation mechanism.
indicator_definition: "The indicator fixed Internet broadband subscriptions, by speed, refers to the number of fixed broadband subscriptions to the public Internet, split by advertised download speed. Fixed Internet broadband subscriptions refer to subscriptions to high-speed access to the public Internet (a TCP/IP connection), at downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s. This includes cable modem, DSL, fibre-to-the-home/building, other fixed (wired)- broadband subscriptions, satellite broadband and terrestrial fixed wireless broadband. This total is measured irrespective of the method of payment. It excludes subscriptions that have access to data communications (including the Internet) via mobile-cellular networks. It should include fixed WiMAX and any other fixed wireless technologies. It includes both residential subscriptions and subscriptions for organizations. The Internet is a worldwide public computer network. It provides access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files. The indicator is currently broken down by the following subscription speeds: \t256 kbit/s to less than 2 Mbit/s subscriptions: Refers to all fixed broadband Internet subscriptions with advertised downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s and less than 2 Mbit/s. \t2 Mbit/s to less than 10 Mbit/s subscriptions: Refers to all fixed -broadband Internet subscriptions with advertised downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 2 Mbit/s and less than 10 Mbit/s. \tEqual to or above 10 Mbit/s subscriptions (4213_G10). Refers to all fixed - broadband Internet subscriptions with advertised downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 10 Mbit/s. ITU collects data for this indicator through an annual questionnaire from national regulatory authorities or Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Ministries, who collect the data from national Internet service providers. The data can be collected by asking each Internet service provider in the country to provide the number of their fixed-broadband subscriptions by the speeds indicated. The data are then added up to obtain the country totals."

  Data is derived from information about Internet access connections in the
  United States as collected by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Form 477
  and published in its Internet Access Services report.  For purposes of that
  report, Internet broadband access connections are those in service, over 200
  kilobits per second (kbps) in at least one direction, and reported to the FCC
  through Form 477. Form 477 collects information about fixed Internet access
  connections in service to end-user premises that are advertised to deliver
  information to and/or from the end user – that is, in at least one direction –
  at transfer rates (speeds) above 200 kilobits per second (kbps). Information
  is collected about the number of connections by the advertised speeds
  associated with each product subscribed to in the relevant geographic area
  (census tracts for fixed). Fixed providers report connections by the maximum
  advertised upload and download speeds.  Fixed connections are further
  categorized by the technology employed by the part of the connection that
  terminates at the end-user premises. “End users” are residential, business,
  institutional, or government entities who use services for their own purposes
  and who do not resell such services to other entities. Facilities-based
  providers report information about connections they provide directly to their
  own end-user customers and also connections that they provide to Internet
  Service Providers for resale to end users. For Form 477 purposes, the
  facilities-based provider of a fixed broadband connection is the entity that
  owns the portion of the physical facility (or obtains the right to use dark
  fiber or satellite transponder capacity as part of its own network) that
  terminates at the end-user premises and provisions/equips it as broadband,
  obtains an unbundled network element (UNE), special access line, or other
  leased facility that terminates at the end-user premises and provisions/equips
  it as broadband, or provisions/equips broadband over terrestrial wireless
  spectrum to the end-user premises. The mutually exclusive Form 477 fixed
  technology categories are: asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (aDSL),
  symmetric Digital Subscriber Line (sDSL), other copper wireline, cable modem,
  optical carrier / fiber to the end user, satellite, terrestrial fixed wireless
  (using licensed or unlicensed spectrum), electric power line, and all other
  (which is included to capture deployment of additional technologies over
  time). In the Form 477 data collection, aDSL-based services delivered over
  fiber-to-the-node architecture are reported in the aDSL category. The other
  wireline category comprises T1/DS1, T3/DS3, and other copper-based
  connections, not elsewhere categorized, that deliver Internet access service
  at the end-user premises. Ethernet connections delivering Internet access
  service are reported in the other wireline category if the connection
  terminates over copper and in the fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) category if the
  connection terminates over fiber. Connections deployed over hybrid fiber-coax
  (HFC) architecture are reported in the cable modem category. Wireless ISPs
  (WISPs) and satellite network operators report in the fixed wireless category.

comments_and_limitations: >-
  The FCC collects information about broadband Internet access subscriptions in
  service that have downstream bandwidths exceeding 200 kbps, rather than 256
  kbps.  Also, consistent with differences between the North American and
  European digital hierarchies, the first natural breakpoint in downstream
  bandwidth in the U.S. data is 1.5 Mbps (that is DS-1) rather than 2 Mbps
