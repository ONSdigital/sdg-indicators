  The 2015 NSDUH binge alcohol and heavy alcohol use data are not comparable to
  prior survey years due to methodological changes, including changing the
  definition in 2015 for females from five to four drinks. See NSDUH
  Methodological Resource Books (MRB) for detailed description of each annaual
  NSDUH survey
  (https://www.samhsa.gov/data/population-data-nsduh/reports?tab=39). The full
  2015 NSDUH should be publicly avaiable by spring 2017.
periodicity: >-

  The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) is an annual survey of the
  civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States aged 12 years
  old or older. The survey covers residents of households and individuals in
  noninstitutional group quarters (e.g., shelters, boarding houses, college
  dormitories, migratory workers' camps, halfway houses). The survey excludes
  people with no fixed address (e.g., homeless people not in shelters), military
  personnel on active duty, and residents of institutional group quarters, such
  as jails, nursing homes, mental institutions, and long-term care hospitals.
  The NSDUH employs a stratified multistage area probability sample that is
  designed to be representative of both the nation as a whole and for each of
  the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
