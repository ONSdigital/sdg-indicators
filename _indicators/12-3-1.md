indicator_name: Global food loss index
target: By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels
  and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest
  losses
indicator_definition: The indicator measures the totality of losses occurring from
  the time at which production of an agricultural product is recorded until it reaches
  the final consumer as food. While calculated on a quantity basis, it is subsequently
  transformed to dietary energy supplies (in kcal) per capita allowing consistent
  aggregation and then indexed. The indicator will be calculated on an annual frequency
  broken down by country and commodity.
