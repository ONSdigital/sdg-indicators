indicator_name: 'Hepatitis B incidence per 100,000 population'
target: >-
  By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected
  tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other
  communicable diseases.
indicator_definition: >-
  The number of new hepatitis B infections per 100,000 population in a given
  year is estimated from the prevalence of total antibodies against hepatitis B
  core antigen (Total anti_HBc) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive
  among children 5 years of age, adjusted for sampling design.
method_of_computation: >-
  Number of survey participants with Total anti_HBc and HBsAg positive test /
  Number in survey with Total anti_Hc/HBsAg result Method of measurement Total
  anti_HBc reflect cumulated incidence in the first five years of life while
  HBsAg reflect chronic infections that may evolve towards chronic liver
  diseases The sample of the serological survey must be drawn from the specific
  geographic region to be verified. For example if the purpose is to estimate
  national transmission of HBV (including mother_to_child transmission) then the
  sampling should be geographically representative of the population.
  Convenience sampling is not appropriate. The sample size should be adequate to
  show with 95% confidence HBsAg prevalence of less than 1% with a precision of
  ' 0.5%. The target age is 5_years_old. Sampling 4 ' 6 year olds may be
  appropriate. The serosurvey is cross sectional and therefore a point estimate
  time. The shorter time periods of data collection are therefore preferred.
  Data on HBV birth dose exposure and B3 completion are drawn from official
  records. Where these are not available testing for HBsAb may be considered for
  the serosurvey. This is less preferable as it is more costly, but can also be
  done in addition. Specimen collection and transportation should be appropriate
  to minimize bias though specimen degradation in rural and remote areas. Where
  possible, it is advantageous to collect blood specimens for ELISA laboratory
  testing because the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) is higher than for
  rapid tests. However in some locations only rapid tests will be available
  hence test selection is resource dependent. This should be considered in
  designing overall study methodology. When an appropriate sampling strategy and
  size are used and quality testing assays and laboratory procedures are
  employed,the HBsAg prevalence in the serosurvey should be representative of
  the incidence of childhood HBV transmission in the specific geographic region
  (or country) in this age group.
