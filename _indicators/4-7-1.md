actual_indicator_available_description: "The assessment, student, and school data are based on a civic framework that incorporates ideas and input from subject area experts, school administrators, policymakers, teachers, parents, and others. The NAEP Civics Framework describes the assessment content and how students' responses are evaluated. This framework shaped the 1998, 2006, 2010, and 2014 civics assessments. The assessment exercises and scoring criteria were developed by a committee of civics educators and curriculum experts to capture the goals of the framework. The framework, which describes the goals of the civics assessment and what kind of exercises it ought to feature, was created by the Board through a comprehensive national process involving educators, researchers, measurement experts, administrators, and members of the general public. The NAEP Civics Standing Committee was instrumental in developing the assessment, guided by the framework. The framework describes the types of texts and questions to be included in the assessment, as well as how the questions should be designed and scored. The framework recommends that the assessment should be organized around three main components: 1) Knowledge; 2) Intellectual and participatory skills; 3) Civic dispositions.

comments_and_limitations: 'The SDG 4.7.1 concept is difficult to define and measure, and it involves a wide array of different concepts and processes that are difficult to reduce to a statistical indicator. Particular with countries with federal education systems, such as the United States, there is no way to measure this indicator with available data even if the concepts were clear. Local and state education agencies are responsible for determining student curriculum. Individual schools of teacher education would set the curriculum for their programs. In 2018, OECD will begin collection of global citizenship data in PISA. The PISA 2018 assessment aims to build a single scale that measures to what extent students are able to use their knowledge and understand, recognize relationships and perspectives, and think critically about a specific global or intercultural issue. This scale would be based solely on the Global Competence cognitive items, see (https://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/Global-competency-for-an-inclusive-world.pdf). This study would offer widely used assessment score that could be compared across countries.  It is strongly recommended to adopt this metric, rather the proposed indicator 4.7.1 which is too broad and vaguely defined to be expressed as a statistical indicator, at least without considerable development. Note that the U.S. response for this indicator is for only one grade group and one element of the potential framework that could be used to construct a composite suitable for measuring the desired concept.'
