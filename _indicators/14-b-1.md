  framework which recognizes and protects access rights for small-scale fisheries
target: Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets
indicator_definition: "The indicator is formulated as Progress by countries in adopting\
  \ and implementing a legal/regulatory/policy/institutional framework which recognizes\
  \ and protects access rights for small-scale fisheries. This indicator measures\
  \ the \"access rights\" aspect of the target. It is a composite indicator based\
  \ on FAO member country responses to the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries\
  \ (CCRF) survey questionnaire6 which is circulated by FAO every two years to members\
  \ and IGOs and INGOs. This indicator is calculated on the basis of the efforts being\
  \ made by countries to implement selected key provisions of the Voluntary Guidelines\
  \ for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security\
  \ and Poverty Eradication (SSF Guidelines;), as reported in a given year of the\
  \ survey. Indicator variables \t1. Existence of instruments that specifically target\
  \ or address the small-scale fisheries sector \t2. Ongoing specific initiatives\
  \ to implement the SSF Guidelines \t3. Existence of mechanisms enabling small-scale\
  \ fishers and fish workers to contribute to decision-making processes Indicator\
  \ calculation The weight given to each of the variables in calculating the indicator\
  \ value for each country are as follows: \tVariable 1 ' 40% \tVariable 2 ' 30% \t\
  Variable 3 ' 30% Scoring The indicator variables are based on three questions which\
  \ are part of the set of questions on small-scale fisheries in the biannual CCRF\
  \ questionnaire survey (as reproduced in the Annex). The unit of measurement of\
  \ the indicator is a score on a scale of 0 to 1, computed through scores and weights\
  \ assigned to the three questions. The national indicator is calculated based on\
  \ these questions specifically focusing on actual efforts of promoting and facilitating\
  \ access rights to small scale fisheries. Responses termed \"no\" in all three questions\
  \ will result in a \"zero\" score for the composite indicator. Maximum score will\
  \ be achieved if all questions are answered \"yes\". As this indicator would be\
  \ reported in the biannual CCRF survey, difference in score as compared to the preceding\
  \ year of the previous survey response will reflect the progress made during the\
  \ survey periods."
