indicator_name: Progress by countries in the degree of application of a legal/regulatory/policy/institutional
  framework which recognizes and protects access rights for small-scale fisheries
target: Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets.
indicator_definition: "The indicator is formulated as Progress by countries in adopting
  and implementing a legal/regulatory/policy/institutional framework which recognizes
  and protects access rights for small-scale fisheries. This indicator measures the
  \"access rights\" aspect of the target. It is a composite indicator based on FAO
  member country responses to the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF)
  survey questionnaire6 which is circulated by FAO every two years to members and
  IGOs and INGOs. This indicator is calculated on the basis of the efforts being made
  by countries to implement selected key provisions of the Voluntary Guidelines for
  Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty
  Eradication (SSF Guidelines;), as reported in a given year of the survey. Indicator
  variables \t1. Existence of instruments that specifically target or address the
  small-scale fisheries sector \t2. Ongoing specific initiatives to implement the
  SSF Guidelines \t3. Existence of mechanisms enabling small-scale fishers and fish
  workers to contribute to decision-making processes Indicator calculation The weight
  given to each of the variables in calculating the indicator value for each country
  are as follows: \tVariable 1 ' 40% \tVariable 2 ' 30% \tVariable 3 ' 30% Scoring
  The indicator variables are based on three questions which are part of the set of
  questions on small-scale fisheries in the biannual CCRF questionnaire survey (as
  reproduced in the Annex). The unit of measurement of the indicator is a score on
  a scale of 0 to 1, computed through scores and weights assigned to the three questions.
  The national indicator is calculated based on these questions specifically focusing
  on actual efforts of promoting and facilitating access rights to small scale fisheries.
  Responses termed \"no\" in all three questions will result in a \"zero\" score for
  the composite indicator. Maximum score will be achieved if all questions are answered
  \"yes\". As this indicator would be reported in the biannual CCRF survey, difference
  in score as compared to the preceding year of the previous survey response will
  reflect the progress made during the survey periods."
