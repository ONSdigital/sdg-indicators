rationale_interpretation: 'Remittances are an important private source of income for migrant families. They benefit wider communities and improve the human development of migrant households. With total remittances going to developing countries projected at USD 454 billion in 2015, reaching the target of reducing remittances to less than 3% would save more than USD 20 billion/year. The G20 has already committed to reducing the transfer costs of remittances (with 5 percentage points over five years), the so''called ''5x 5 initiative''. To monitor this commitment, a designated group in the World bank was created to monitor the implementation of this commitment.'
