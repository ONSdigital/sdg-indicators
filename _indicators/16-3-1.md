This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator and has been identified in collaboration with topic experts. We will work to develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification.

Data availability within the UK is limited to England and Wales for this indicator.


The Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at <SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk>
