  By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities
indicator_name: CO2emission per unit of value added



national_indicator_available: >-
  CO2 emissions (in kilotonnes) divided by gross value added (GVA) chained volume measure (CVM).
national_indicator_description: >-
  Units of CO2 emitted used per unit of GVA (CVM), as an indicator of energy efficiency by sector. The Chained Volume Measures are created from the short term measures of output. The majority of indicators in the short term measures are measuring changes in output as a proxy for changes in GVA. At the reference year (currently 2015) the values are set equal to current price GVA values.

  CO2 emission per unit of value added is a ratio indicator between the carbon emission and value added. Carbon emission is estimated from the data on energy consumption. Carbon emission per unit of value added is a universal indicator for measuring the impact of industrial production on environment. It captures the intensity of energy use, energy efficiency of production technology and most importantly use of fossil fuels. This indicator can also be presented as CO2 emission per unit of output. Energy consumption and value added data are available for more than 150 countries from UNIDO MVA database and UNSD energy database as well as International Energy Agency (IEA) database. Emission data are directly reported by NSOs in many cases. Gross value added (GVA) is the measure of the value of goods and services produced in an area, industry or sector of an economy. In national accounts GVA is output minus intermediate consumption; it is the value generated by any unit engaged in the production of goods and services.
