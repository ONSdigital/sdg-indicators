  Carbon emission per unit of value added is a universal indicator for measuring
  the impact of industrial production on environment. It captures the intensity
  of energy use, energy efficiency of production technology and most importantly
  use of fossil fuels. This indicator can also be presented as CO2 emission per
  unit of output.

indicator_name: CO2 emission per unit of value added
target: >-
  By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them
  sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of
  clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with
  all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities.
indicator_definition: >-
  CO2 emission per unit of value added is a ratio indicator between the carbon
  emission and value added. Carbon emission is estimated from the data on energy
  consumption.
