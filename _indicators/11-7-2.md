computation_calculations: >-
  The theory underpinning this calculation: taking the total number of adults aged 16 to 59 in England and Wales who experienced incidents of indecent exposure or unwanted sexual touching in the previous twelve months and divided this by the total number of adults with the same age category in England/Wales and multiplied by 100. 
computation_numerator: >-
  Number of adults aged 16-59 in England and Wales who experienced incidents of indecent exposure or unwanted sexual touching in the previous twelve months * 100 
computation_denominator: Number of adults aged 16-59 in England and Wales

computation_disaggregation: >-
  This can be disaggregated by sex (male and female). Sexual assault category (by partner, by family member). This disaggregation can be further disaggregated amongst each other (e.g. sexual assault category by sex). 
comments_limitations: >-
  Presently the only ages covered are between 16 and 59 but the upper bound of this is likely to increase over time. The original figures refer to data that runs from April of that year to March the following year. For example 2015 data date range is from April 2015 to March 2016. The headline data are published in July, however the specific breakdowns (disaggregationâ€™s, i.e. age, gender, etc) are published in February. Coverage is limited to England and Wales.
