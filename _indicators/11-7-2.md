  Sexual harassment is a violation of women's human rights and a prohibited form
  of violence against women in many countries.[4] Sexually harassing conduct
  causes devastating physical and psychological injuries to a large percentage
  of women in workplaces around the world. In urban and rural areas, developed
  or developing countries, women and girls are constantly subjected to these
  forms of violence on streets, on public transport, in shopping centres and in
  public parks, in and around schools and workplaces, in public sanitation
  facilities and water and food distribution sites, or in their own
  neighborhoods. Such harassment reinforces the subordination of women to men in
  society, violates women's dignity and creates a health and safety hazard in
  public spaces. 

  If women and girls are to enjoy a life free from violence, policymakers need
  to ensure that public spaces are free from any form of violence, including
  sexual harassment.

  The theory underpinning this calculation: taking the total number of adults
  aged 16 to 59 in England and Wales who experienced incidents of indecent
  exposure or unwanted sexual touching in the previous twelve months and divided
  this by the total number of adults with the same age category in England/Wales
  and multiplied by 100.
