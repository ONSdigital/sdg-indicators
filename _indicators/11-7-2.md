  Sexual harassment is a violation of women's human rights and a prohibited form
  of violence against women in many countries.[4] Sexually harassing conduct
  causes devastating physical and psychological injuries to a large percentage
  of women in workplaces around the world. In urban and rural areas, developed
  or developing countries, women and girls are constantly subjected to these
  forms of violence on streets, on public transport, in shopping centres and in
  public parks, in and around schools and workplaces, in public sanitation
  facilities and water and food distribution sites, or in their own
  neighborhoods. Such harassment reinforces the subordination of women to men in
  society, violates women's dignity and creates a health and safety hazard in
  public spaces. 

  If women and girls are to enjoy a life free from violence, policymakers need
  to ensure that public spaces are free from any form of violence, including
  sexual harassment.

  Proportion of persons victim of physical or sexual harassment, by sex, age,

target: >-
  By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and
  public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons
  with disabilities.
indicator_definition: >-
  Number of girls and women aged 15+ who were subjected to physical or sexual
  harassment in the last 12 months, as percentage of all women aged 15+,
  disaggregated by perpetrator and place of occurrence (of latest episode). Many
  international bodies, national legislatures and courts have prohibited sexual
  harassment but there is no agreed universal definition of the term.[1] Most
  existing studies about sexual harassment are focused on working life or
  educational environments and measure unwelcome and unwanted sexual acts.[1,2]
  Because of the lack of universal definition, data for this indicator are not
  comparable. Currently, comparable data exist only for the 28 European Union
  countries (see below for more details on existing measures).
