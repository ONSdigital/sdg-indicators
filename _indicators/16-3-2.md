indicator_name: Unsentenced detainees as proportion of overall prison population
target: Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure
  equal access to justice for all.
indicator_definition: The total number of persons held in detention who have not yet
  been sentenced, as a percentage of the total number of persons held in detention,
  on a specified date. 'Sentenced' refers to persons subject to criminal proceedings
  who have received a decision from a competent authority regarding their conviction
  or acquittal. For the purposes of the indicator, persons who have received a 'non-final'
  decision (such as where a conviction is subject to appeal) are considered to be
  'sentenced'.
