  The indicator signifies overall respect for the principle that persons
  awaiting trial shall not be detained in custody. This, in turn, is premised on
  aspects of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. From a
  development perspective, extensive use of pre-sentence detention when not
  necessary for reasons such as the prevention of absconding, the protection of
  victims or witnesses, or the prevention of the commission of further offences,
  can divert criminal justice system resources, and exert financial and
  unemployment burdens on the accused and his or her family. Measuring the
  relative extent to which pre-sentence detention is used can provide the
  evidence to assist countries in lowering such burdens and ensuring its
  proportionate use.

indicator_name: Unsentenced detainees as proportion of overall prison population
target: >-
  Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure
  equal access to justice for all.
indicator_definition: >-
  The total number of persons held in detention who have not yet been sentenced,
  as a percentage of the total number of persons held in detention, on a
  specified date. 'Sentenced' refers to persons subject to criminal proceedings
  who have received a decision from a competent authority regarding their
  conviction or acquittal. For the purposes of the indicator, persons who have
  received a 'non-final' decision (such as where a conviction is subject to
  appeal) are considered to be 'sentenced'.

  National Prisoners Statistics (NPS) - Started in 1926 under a mandate from
  Congress, NPS collects annual data on prisoners at yearend. The Bureau of
  Justice Statistics (BJS) sponsors the survey, and the U.S. Census Bureau
  serves as the data collection agent. The NPS distinguishes between inmates in
  custody and prisoners under jurisdiction. To have custody of a prisoner, a
  state or the BOP must hold that inmate in one of its facilities. To have
  jurisdiction over a prisoner, the state or BOP must have legal authority over
  that prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is incarcerated or supervised.
  The NPS jurisdiction counts include persons held in prisons, penitentiaries,
  correctional facilities, halfway houses, boot camps, farms, training or
  treatment centers, and hospitals. Counts also include prisoners who were
  temporarily absent (less than 30 days), in court, or on work release; housed
  in privately operated facilities, local jails, or other state or federal
  facilities; and serving concurrent sentences for more than one correctional
  authority. The NPS custody counts include all inmates held within a
  respondentâ€™s facilities, including inmates housed for other correctional
  facilities. The custody counts exclude inmates held in local jails and in
  other jurisdictions. With a few exceptions, the NPS custody counts exclude
  inmates held in privately operated facilities. Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ) -
  In years between a complete census of local jails, the Bureau of Justice
  Statistics (BJS) conducts the Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ). ASJ uses a
  stratified probability sample of jail jurisdictions to estimate the number and
  characteristics of local inmates nationwide. In the sampling design, the jail
  jurisdictions nationwide are grouped into 10 strata. In 2013-14 and 2015, the
  10 strata were defined by two variables: the jail jurisdiction average daily
  population (ADP), and whether the jurisdiction held at least one juvenile. For
  8 of the 10 strata, a random sample of jail jurisdictions was selected. For
  the remaining two strata, all jurisdictions were included in the sample. One
  stratum consisted of all jails that were operated jointly by two or more
  jurisdictions (referred to as multi-jurisdictional jails). The other stratum
  (referred to as certainty stratum) consisted of all jail jurisdictions that
  held juvenile inmates at the time of the Census of Jail Inmates (2005 Census
  for ASJ 2013-14; 2013 Census for ASJ 2015)and had an ADP of 500 or more
  inmates during the 12 months ending June 30, 2005 (for ASJ 2013-14) or ending
  December 31, 2013 (for ASJ 2015) or held only adult inmates and had an ADP of
  750 or more. BJS obtains data from sampled jail jurisdictions by mailed and
  web-based survey questionnaires. After follow-up phone calls, the item
  response rate for jails that responded to the survey was nearly 100% for
  critical items. BJS implements nonresponse weight adjustment procedures to
  account for unit nonresponse. See BJS website for questionnaires and
  additional metadata: https://www.bjs.gov/.
