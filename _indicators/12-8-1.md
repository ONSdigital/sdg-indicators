This is not a statistical indicator. However, we will collaborate with the policy lead in the UK so that we are able to link to the relevant legislative framework.

The Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at <SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk>
