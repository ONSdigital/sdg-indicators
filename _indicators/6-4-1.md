rationale_interpretation: "The rationale behind this indicator consists in providing information on the efficiency of the economic and social usage of water resources, i.e. output generated by the use of water in the different main sectors of the economy, and distribution network losses. Energy production has been disaggregated from the industrial sector due to its specific importance for the general development of a country. \nThe distribution efficiency of water systems is explicitly considered only for the municipal sector, but it is nonetheless implicit within the calculations also for the other sectors, and could be made explicit if needed and where data are available. \nThis indicator addresses specifically the target component 'substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors', by measuring the output per unit of water from productive uses of water as well as losses in municipal water use. It does not aim at giving an exhaustive picture of the water utilization in a country. Other indicators, specifically those for Targets 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 5.4, 5.a, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 will complement the information provided by this indicator. In particular, the indicator needs to be combined with the water stress indicator 6.4.2 to provide adequate follow-up of the target formulation. \nTogether, the four sectoral efficiencies provide a measure of overall efficiency in a country. The indicator provides incentives to improve water use efficiency through all sectors, highlighting those sectors where water use efficiency is lagging behind."

indicator_name: "Change in water-use efficiency over time"
target: "By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity."
indicator_definition: "This indicator is defined as the output over time of a given major sector per volume of (net) water withdrawn (showing the trend in water use efficiency). Following ISIC 4 coding, sectors are defined as agriculture, forestry and fishing (ISIC 4-A); manufacturing, constructions, mining and quarrying (ISIC 4-B, 4-C and 4-F); electricity industry (ISIC 4-D); and the municipal sector (ISIC 4-E). For the purpose of this note, the following terminology is used: 	Water use: general non-specific term that describes any action through which water provides a service 	Water withdrawal: water abstracted from a river, lake, reservoir or aquifer(V) 	Return flow: water returning to a river, lake, reservoir or aquifer (R) 	Net water withdrawal: water withdrawn (V) minus return flow (R) Note: If no information is available on (R), then only (V) will be used."

method_of_computation: "The indicator is disaggregated by sector, in order to allow for different metrics in different sectors. Water efficiency in irrigated agriculture is calculated as the agricultural value added per agricultural (net) water withdrawn, expressed in USD/m3. In formula: Awe = GVAa x (1-Cr)Va-Ra Where: 	Awe = Irrigated agriculture water efficiency [USD/m3] 	GVAa = Gross value added by agriculture (excluding river and marine fisheries and forestry)[USD] 	Cr = Proportion of agricultural GVA produced by rainfed agriculture [-] 	Va =  Volume of water withdrawn by the agricultural sector (including irrigation, livestock and aquaculture) [m3] 	Ra = Volume of water returned to the hydrologic system (return flow) [m3]  The volume of water withdrawn by the agricultural sectors (V) is collected at country level through national records and reported in questionnaires, in units of km3/year or million m3/year (see example in AQUASTAT http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-quest_eng.xls). Agricultural value added in national currency is obtained from national statistics, converted to USD and deflated to the baseline year 2015. The Cr coefficient can be estimated as Cr= 37%, on the basis of the general FAO assumption on the ratio between rainfed and irrigated yield. More detailed estimations are however possible and encouraged at country level. Water efficiency of industries is calculated as the industrial value added per unit of industrial (net) water withdrawn, and expressed in USD/m3. In formula: Iwe = GVAiVi-Ri Where: 	Iwe = Irrigated water efficiency [USD/m3] 	GVAi = Gross value added by industry (excluding energy)[USD] 	Vi =  Volume of water withdrawn by the industries (excluding energy) [m3] 	Ri = Volume of water returned to the hydrologic system (return flow) [m3]  Industrial water withdrawal (V) is collected at country level through national records and reported in questionnaires, in units of km3/year or million m3/year (see example in AQUASTAT http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-quest_eng.xls). Industrial value added is obtained from national statistics, deflated to the baseline year 2015. Energy (power) water efficiency is calculated as the value added of power production per unit of (net) water withdrawn for energy production, and expressed in MWh/m3. In formula: Ewe = TEPVe-Re Where: 	Ewe = Energy water efficiency [MWh/m3] 	TEP = Total energy production [MWh] 	Ve =  Volume of water withdrawn for energy production, i.e. for the cooling of power plants (including evaporation from reservoirs created behind dams for hydropower) [m3] 	Re = Volume of water returned to the hydrologic system (return flow) [m3]  Volume of water withdrawn for energy production (V) is collected at country level through national records and reported in questionnaires, in units of km3/year or million m3/year (see example in AQUASTAT http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-quest_eng.xls). Value added of electricity production is obtained from national statistics, deflated to the baseline year 2015. Municipal water supply efficiency is the ratio between water effectively distributed to the municipal users and the water withdrawn for municipal use by water supply utilities (i.e. distribution efficiency, size of network losses). In formula: Mwe = MudVm Where: 	Mwe = Municipal water supply efficiency [-] 	Mud = Water distributed to municipal users [m3] 	Vm = Volume of water withdrawn by municipal utilities (i.e. the public distribution network) [m3] Data on volumes of withdrawn and distributed are collected at country level from the municipal supply utilities records."
