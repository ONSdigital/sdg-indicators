indicator_name: Change in water-use efficiency over time
target: By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and
  ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity
  and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity.
indicator_definition: "This indicator is defined as the output over time of a given
  major sector per volume of (net) water withdrawn (showing the trend in water use
  efficiency). Following ISIC 4 coding, sectors are defined as agriculture, forestry
  and fishing (ISIC 4-A); manufacturing, constructions, mining and quarrying (ISIC
  4-B, 4-C and 4-F); electricity industry (ISIC 4-D); and the municipal sector (ISIC
  4-E). For the purpose of this note, the following terminology is used: \tWater use:
  general non-specific term that describes any action through which water provides
  a service \tWater withdrawal: water abstracted from a river, lake, reservoir or
  aquifer(V) \tReturn flow: water returning to a river, lake, reservoir or aquifer
  (R) \tNet water withdrawal: water withdrawn (V) minus return flow (R) Note: If no
  information is available on (R), then only (V) will be used."
