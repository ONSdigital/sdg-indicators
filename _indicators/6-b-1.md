indicator_name: "Proportion of local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management"
target: "Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management."
indicator_definition: "This indicator builds on data that are already regularly collected by UN-Water GLAAS on the presence, at the national level, of clearly defined procedures in laws or policies for participation by service users. NThis indicator will also build on the data collected for the Status of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) reporting in SDG target 6.5, in particular on the presence of formal stakeholder structures established at sub-catchment level. Because of the above, it is envisaged that this indicator will evolve and will be further qualified during the SDG period, focussing on sanitation, drinking water and hygiene first and then expanding on water resources management."
