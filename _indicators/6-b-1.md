  This indicator builds on data that are already regularly collected by UN-Water
  GLAAS on the presence, at the national level, of clearly defined procedures in
  laws or policies for participation by service users. This indicator will also
  build on the data collected for the Status of Integrated Water Resources
  Management (IWRM) reporting in SDG target 6.5, in particular on the presence
  of formal stakeholder structures established at sub-catchment level. Because
  of the above, it is envisaged that this indicator will evolve and will be
  further qualified during the SDG period, focussing on sanitation, drinking
  water and hygiene first and then expanding on water resources management.
