indicator_name: Proportion of local administrative units with established and operational
  policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation
  management
target: Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving
  water and sanitation management.
indicator_definition: This indicator builds on data that are already regularly collected
  by UN-Water GLAAS on the presence, at the national level, of clearly defined procedures
  in laws or policies for participation by service users. NThis indicator will also
  build on the data collected for the Status of Integrated Water Resources Management
  (IWRM) reporting in SDG target 6.5, in particular on the presence of formal stakeholder
  structures established at sub-catchment level. Because of the above, it is envisaged
  that this indicator will evolve and will be further qualified during the SDG period,
  focussing on sanitation, drinking water and hygiene first and then expanding on
  water resources management.
