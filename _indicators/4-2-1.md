indicator_name: Proportion of children under 5 years of age who are developmentally
  on track in health, learning and psychosocial well-being, by sex
target: By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood
  development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education.
indicator_definition: 'From UNESCO:The percentage of children at the start of primary
  school, typically age 6 years in many countries, who demonstrate age-appropriate
  health, learning and psychosocial well-being and possess the necessary competencies
  and knowledge required for learning in the early primary grades. The age at which
  children start primary school varies across countries. This means that the indicator
  may broadly reflect children''s development between about five and seven years of
  age.From UNICEF: This indicator provides the proportion of children under the age
  of five who are developmentally on track in health, learning and psychosocial well-being.
  It is calculated by dividing the number of children under the age of five who are
  developmentally on track in health, learning and psychosocial well-being by the
  total number of children under the age of five in the population.'
