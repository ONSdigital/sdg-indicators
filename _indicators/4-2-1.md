  From UNESCO:

  The indicator is a broad measure of children's development and their
  preparedness to begin school. Available data for global tracking is presently
  collected from individual-level data reported by care-givers or teachers,
  which is then used to calculate an indicator that represents a composite
  measure across a range of agreed characteristics in the areas of health,
  learning and psychosocial well-being.


  From UNICEF: 

  Early childhood development sets the stage for life-long thriving. Investing
  in ECD is one of the most critical and cost-effective ways to improve adult
  health, education and productivity. ECD is equity from the start and provides
  a good indication of national development and efforts to improve ECD can bring
  about human, social and economic improvements for both individuals and
  societies.

  Proportion of children under 5 years of age who are developmentally on track
  in health, learning and psychosocial well-being, by sex
target: >-
  By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood
  development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary
  education.
indicator_definition: >-
  From UNESCO:The percentage of children at the start of primary school,
  typically age 6 years in many countries, who demonstrate age-appropriate
  health, learning and psychosocial well-being and possess the necessary
  competencies and knowledge required for learning in the early primary grades.
  The age at which children start primary school varies across countries. This
  means that the indicator may broadly reflect children's development between
  about five and seven years of age.From UNICEF: This indicator provides the
  proportion of children under the age of five who are developmentally on track
  in health, learning and psychosocial well-being. It is calculated by dividing
  the number of children under the age of five who are developmentally on track
  in health, learning and psychosocial well-being by the total number of
  children under the age of five in the population.

  Approaches to learning, interpersonal skills, self-control, health
  mathematics, and reading performance of entering kindergarten students in the
  US (typically age 5),
actual_indicator_available_description: "The approaches to learning scale is based on teachers' reports on how students rate in seven areas: attentiveness, task persistence, eagerness to learn, learning independence, ability to adapt easily to changes in routine, organization, and ability to follow classroom rules. Possible scores on the approaches to learning scale range from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating that a child exhibits positive learning behaviors more often. The interpersonal skills scale is based on teachers' reports on the student’s skill in forming and maintaining friendships; getting along with people who are different; comforting or helping other children; expressing feelings, ideas, and opinions in positive ways; and showing sensitivity to the feelings of others. Possible scores on the interpersonal skills scale range from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating that a child interacted with others in a positive way more often. The self-control scale is based on teachers' reports on the student’s ability to control behavior by respecting the property rights of others, controlling temper, accepting peer ideas for group activities, and responding appropriately to pressure from peers. Possible scores on the self-control scale range from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating that a child exhibited behaviors indicative of self-control more often. Reading score reflects performance on questions measuring basic skills (print familiarity, letter recognition, beginning and ending sounds, rhyming words, and word recognition); vocabulary knowledge; and reading comprehension, including identifying information specifically stated in text (e.g., definitions, facts, and supporting details), making complex inferences from texts, and considering the text objectively and judging its appropriateness and quality. Possible scores for the reading assessment range from 0 to 120. Mathematics score reflects performance on questions on number sense, properties, and operations; measurement; geometry and spatial sense; data analysis, statistics, and probability (measured with a set of simple questions assessing children’s ability to read a graph); and prealgebra skills such as identification of patterns. Possible scores for the mathematics assessment range from 0 to 113. Socioeconomic status (SES) was measured by a composite score based on parental education and occupations and household income during the child’s kindergarten year.
