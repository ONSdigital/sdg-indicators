  Grounds of discrimination prohibited under international human rights law, as enshrined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequently elaborated upon by international human rights mechanisms, include ethnicity, sex, age, income, geographic location, disability, religion, migratory or displacement status, civil status, sexual orientation and gender identity. In the United Kingdom, hate crime is defined as ‘any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards someone based on a personal characteristic.’ This common definition was agreed in 2007 by the police, Crown Prosecution Service, Prison Service (now the National Offender Management Service) and other agencies that make up the criminal justice system. There are five centrally monitored strands of hate crime: race or ethnicity; religion or beliefs; sexual orientation; disability; and transgender identity. In the process of recording a crime, police can flag an offence as being motivated by one or more of the five monitored strands listed above (for example, an offence can be motivated by hostility towards the victim’s race and religion). Figures presented have been calculated from the total number of motivating factors.

  An offence may be motivated by hatred towards a characteristic (strand) that is not centrally monitored and therefore would not be represented in this data (age or gender for example).
  Operationally, such an offence could still be investigated as a hate crime by the police. For further information please see College of Policing, Hate Crime, Operational Guidance @ http://www.report-it.org.uk/files/hate_crime_operational_guidance.pdf
