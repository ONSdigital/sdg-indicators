indicator_name: Proportion of population reporting having personally felt discriminated
  against or harassed in the previous 12 months on the basis of a ground of discrimination
  prohibited under international human rights law
target: Promote and enforce non-discriminatory laws and policies for sustainable development.
indicator_definition: Grounds of discrimination prohibited under international human
  rights law, as enshrined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequently
  elaborated upon by international human rights mechanisms, include ethnicity, sex,
  age, income, geographic location, disability, religion, migratory or displacement
  status, civil status, sexual orientation and gender identity. While some grounds
  are common to all countries and follow standard definitions, such as sex, age or
  disability, the precise categories to be included under grounds such as ethnicity,
  geographic location and religion will vary according to national circumstances and
  should be determined in a participatory process at national level. The indicator
  is calculated as the percentage of persons reporting having personally felt discriminated
  against or harassed within the last 12 months on the basis of a ground of discrimination
  prohibited under international human rights law. This will be calculated using the
  full survey results, with techniques of imputation, estimation and data weighting
  to ensure a representative sample and data reliability.
