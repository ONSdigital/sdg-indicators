  NEET provides a measure of youth who are outside the educational system, not
  in training and not in employment, and thus serves as a broader measure of
  potential youth labour market entrants than youth unemployment. A high NEET
  rate as compared with the youth unemployment rate could mean that a large
  number of youth are discouraged workers, or do not have access to education or
  training. A high NEET rate among females as compared with males is often an
  indication of gender imbalances, with female youth engaged in household chores
  such as washing clothes, cooking, cleaning and taking care of siblings.

  https://www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#reliability       There was a major
  redesign to the Current Population Survey beginning in 1994, so data for
  earlier years are not strictly comparable to those from 1994 onward.
