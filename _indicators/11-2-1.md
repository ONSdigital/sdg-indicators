rationale_interpretation: "\n\tAlthough it is an indicator not easy to collect in all cities/countries in the world, it proposes an innovative mechanism of data collection and analysis. \n\tAs the Outcome Document 2nd Meeting of the Urban SDGs Campaign in Bangalore (12-14 February 2015) recognizes: \n\t\tNo internationally agreed methodology exists for measuring convenience and service quality of public transport. In addition, global/local on urban transport systems do not exist. Moreover, data is not harmonized and comparable at the world level. \n\t\tTo obtain this data will require collecting it at municipal/city level with serious deficiencies in some areas such as data on mass transit and on transport infrastructure. \n\tThe European Commission, on the contrary, considers that 'this is a good indicator which can be collected in a relatively straightforward way' (DG REGIO, 2015). The assessment of the indicator done by the EC applies only for cities in the developed world, and not all. \n\tThe EC document highlights that the indicator was calculated for 80 European cities and stresses that the estimation requires the following data availability: (1) geo-coded public transport stops and the number of departures at each stop, (2) a high resolution GIS layer with population (for example census enumeration areas or a population grid) and (3) a street network (if available). \n\tHowever, these data requirements are not available in most middle income countries.\n\tUN-Habitat disagrees with this rating. This is a very relevant indicator. It is empirically proven that public transport makes cities more inclusive, safe and sustainable. \n\tEffective and low-cost transportation for mobility is critical for urban poverty and inequalities reduction, and economic development because it provides access to jobs, health care, education services and other public goods. \n\tClean Public transport is very efficient for the reduction of C02 emissions and therefore it contributes to climate change."

indicator_name: "Proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport, by sex, age and persons with disabilities"
target: "By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons."
indicator_definition: "\n\tThe indicator is suitable, particularly in the countries/cities where the information exists. The Target is too broad intending to measure multiple aspects of urban mobility. The indicator covers three critical aspects of this target: accessible in distance, energy-efficient and the expansion of public transport. \n\tUN-Habitat position, in line with all the organizations supporting this indicator, is that necessary adjustments are required to minimize its complexity and make it more suitable for global monitoring. \n\tThe indicator can be measured by a proxy, which is the proportion of the population that has a public transit stop within 0.5 km. This reduces the complexity of the 20 minutes (which is very variable in different hours of the day or days of the week). \n\tIn case there is no spatial information on the population location and density, the indicator can measure the proportion of the surface that has a public transit stop. \n\tAs cities/countries evolve in their data collection systems, the indicator could be harmonized to include the elements indicated by the EC (street network and frequency of the transport)."
