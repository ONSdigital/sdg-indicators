rationale_interpretation: 'This indicator combines the poverty indicator under the first target (1a) of the MDGs on the eradication of poverty with the corresponding working indicator for monitoring the second target (1b) of the MDGs on decent work. By combining poverty status with employment status, the concept of the working poor is captured, which aims to measure how many workers, despite being in employment, live in poverty.'

indicator_name: 'Proportion of population below the international poverty line, by sex, age, employment status and geographical location (urban/rural)'
target: 'By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day.'
indicator_definition: 'This indicator provides the proportion of the total population and the proportion of the employed population living in households with per-capita consumption or income that is below the international poverty line of US$1.25.'
actual_indicator_available: 'Proportion of population living in households with incomes less than 7% of the poverty thresholds.'
actual_indicator_available_description: 'If you multiply 1.25 by 365 you get 456.25.  That''s the international poverty line for one person.  If you multiply this number by 2 you get the line for 2 people, by 3 for 3 people, etc.  If you average out this value for all poverty threshold family sizes, it comes out to about 7% of the national poverty line.'
method_of_computation: 'Calculated by dividing the number of persons living in households below the poverty line (disaggregated by sex, age and employment status) by the total number of persons (disaggregated by the same sex, age and employment status groups).'
