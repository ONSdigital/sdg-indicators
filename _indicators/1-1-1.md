  This indicator combines the poverty indicator under the first target (1a) of
  the MDGs on the eradication of poverty with the corresponding working
  indicator for monitoring the second target (1b) of the MDGs on decent work. By
  combining poverty status with employment status, the concept of the working
  poor is captured, which aims to measure how many workers, despite being in
  employment, live in poverty.

  Proportion of population below the international poverty line, by sex, age,
  employment status and geographical location (urban/rural)
target: >-
  By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently
  measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day.
indicator_definition: >-
  This indicator provides the proportion of the total population and the
  proportion of the employed population living in households with per-capita
  consumption or income that is below the international poverty line of US$1.25.
actual_indicator_available: >-
  Proportion of population living in households with incomes less than 7% of the
  poverty thresholds.
actual_indicator_available_description: >-
  If you multiply 1.25 by 365 you get 456.25.  That's the international poverty
  line for one person.  If you multiply this number by 2 you get the line for 2
  people, by 3 for 3 people, etc.  If you average out this value for all poverty
  threshold family sizes, it comes out to about 7% of the national poverty line.
method_of_computation: >-
  Calculated by dividing the number of persons living in households below the
  poverty line (disaggregated by sex, age and employment status) by the total
  number of persons (disaggregated by the same sex, age and employment status
  groups).
