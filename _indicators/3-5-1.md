  and rehabilitation and aftercare services) for substance use disorders
target: Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic
  drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol.
indicator_definition: "Treatment of substance use disorder as defined by the Political
  Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation Towards an integrated
  and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem, High Level Segment, Commission
  on Narcotic Drugs, Vienna 11- 12 March 2009. Comprehensive treatment system offering
  a wide range of integrated pharmacological (such as detoxification and opioid agonist
  and antagonist maintenance) and psychosocial (such as counselling, cognitive behavioural
  therapy and social support) interventions based on scientific evidence and focused
  on the process of rehabilitation, recovery and social reintegration (Plan of Action,
  Para 4:h) Services for the treatment of drug disorders' are part of clinical responses
  to substancerelated disorders. Such services are aimed at stopping or reducing the
  effects of acute intoxication, managing withdrawal symptoms during detoxification,
  preventing relapse and dealing with long-term psychological and behavioural symptoms..
  (E/NR/2014/2)1 Substance use disorders, occur when the recurrent use of alcohol
  and/or drugs causes clinically and functionally significant impairment, such as
  health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work,
  school, or home. According to the DSM-5, a diagnosis of substance use disorder is
  based on evidence of impaired control, social impairment, risky use, and pharmacological
  criteria. (DSM V) Pharmacological Interventions include cluster of interventions
  such as detoxification, , opioid antagonist therapy, and opioid maintenance therapy
  (E/NR/2014/2) \tDetoxification refers to a process carried out in a safe and effective
  manner aimed at eliminating or minimizing withdrawal symptoms that occur after drugs
  are no longer taken (WHO). \tOpioid maintenance therapy refers to the regular administration
  of a long-acting opioid agonist to stabilize the patient without applying tapering
  dosage schedules. (WHO, UNODC, UNAIDS Technical Guide for Countries to Set Targets
  for Universal Access to HIV Prevention, Treatment and Care for Injecting Drug Users
  (WHO, Geneva, 2009) \tOpioid antagonist maintenance treatment refers to the regular
  administration of a long-acting opioid antagonist to block opioid receptors and
  avoid any opioid effect (adapted from WHO, 2009). Psychosocial cluster of interventions
  such as treatment planning, counselling, peer support groups, screening/brief intervention,
  contingency management, cognitive behavioural therapy, treatment of comorbidity,
  motivational interviewing. \tTreatment planning refers to the development of a written
  description of the treatment to be provided and its anticipated course. Such planning
  is done with the patient by establishing goals based on the patient's identified
  needs and setting interventions to meet those goals (UNODC, Principles of Drug Dependence
  Treatment: Discussion Paper, March 2008). \tCounselling refers to an intensive interpersonal
  process aimed at assisting individuals to achieve their goals or function more effectively
  (WHO). \tPeer support groups (self-help groups such as Narcotics Anonymous) refers
  to small groups of peers wishing to assist each other in their struggle with a particular
  problem (in the case of Narcotics Anonymous, with drug dependence) (WHO). \tScreening
  is aimed at detecting health problems or risk factors at an early stage before they
  have caused serious disease or other problems (WHO). A 'brief intervention' is a
  structured therapy of short duration aimed at assisting an individual to cease or
  reduce the use of a psychoactive substance or to deal with other life issues (WHO).
  \tContingency management' refers to psychosocial interventions that provide a system
  of incentives and disincentives designed to make drug use less attractive and abstinence
  more attractive (NIDA). \tCognitive behavioural therapy refers to psychosocial interventions
  aimed at helping patients recognize, avoid and cope with the situations in which
  they are most likely to use drugs (adapted from NIDA). \tMotivational interviewing
  refers to a counselling and assessment technique that follows a non-confrontational
  approach to questioning people about difficult issues like alcohol and drug use,
  assisting them to make positive decisions aimed at reducing or stopping such use
  (ODCCP). Social rehabilitation and aftercare include a cluster of interventions
  such as vocational training, social assistance, educational activities, rehabilitation
  and aftercare. \tVocational training and income-generation support' refers to activities
  aimed at providing participants with the skills and opportunities to engage in meaningful
  employment and sustainably support themselves and their families. \tSocial assistance
  refers to the many ways in which professionals and nonprofessionals can support
  the social and psychological well-being of drug users with a view to improving both
  the quality and duration of their lives (WHO, Guidelines for the Psychosocially
  Assisted Pharmacological Treatment of Opioid Dependence, 2009). \tEducational activities
  on the risks posed by drug use refer to sessions aimed at informing and counselling
  people about the consequences of drug use, in other words, the ways in which such
  use affects physical and mental health, behavioural control and interpersonal relationships.
  In particular, these educational sessions should focus on providing information
  about overdosing, contracting infectious diseases, developing cardiovascular, metabolic
  and psychiatric disorders etc. and the benefit of abstaining from drug use. Treatment
  methods and goals are also explained in detail. \tRehabilitation and aftercare refers
  to the process aimed at achieving an optimal state of health, psychological functioning
  and social well-being for individuals with a drugrelated problem (WHO). Coverage
  Coverage describes the extent to which an intervention is delivered to the target
  population, that is, the proportion of the target population in need of an intervention
  that actually gets it. Coverage has to be determined relative to the national estimates
  of people in need, e.g., people with substance use disorders, or people vulnerable
  to substance use. (Economic and Social Council (E/NR/2014/2) Commission on Narcotics
  Drugs, Annual Report Questionnaire; Part 2:COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO DRUG DEMAND
  AND SUPPLY REDUCTION)"
