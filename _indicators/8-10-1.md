  People and businesses need access to financial services that are safe,
  reliable, and convenient. The high costs of providing these services,
  particularly to those living and working in more remote areas or for those
  whose transaction values are low, have led to limited access. New technologies
  and delivery channels are lowering costs and bringing timely and appropriate
  services to even more people, but require the institutions providing or
  partnering to provide services to have the capability to design and deliver
  these services.
