indicator_definition: 'From UNICEF:  This indicator provides the proportion of children
  under the age of five whose births are reported as being registered with the relevant
  national civil authorities. It is calculated by dividing the number of children
  under the age of five whose births are reported as being registered with the relevant
  national civil authorities by the total number of children under the age of five
  in the population.  From Goal 16 TST Working Group: The indicator is calculated
  as the number of children whose births have been registered with a civil authority
  divided by the total number of children.  From UNFPA: Percentage of births that
  are registered within a certain period of time after birth (one month, one year,
  five years of age) in a civil registration and vital statistics system or from household
  surveys.'
