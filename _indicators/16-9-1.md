  From UNICEF: 
   Registering children at birth is the first step in securing their recognition before the law, safeguarding their rights, and ensuring that any violation of these rights does not go unnoticed. 
  Children without official identification documents may be denied health care
  or education. Later in life, the lack of such documentation can mean that a
  child may enter into marriage or the labour market, or be conscripted into the
  armed forces, before the legal age. In adulthood, birth certificates may be
  required to obtain social assistance or a job in the formal sector, to buy or
  prove the right to inherit property, to vote and to obtain a passport. 

   From Goal 16 TST Working Group: 
  Article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) provides that all
  children should be registered immediately after birth and have the right from
  birth to a name and the right to acquire a nationality. Article 8 CRC further
  provides that, where a child is illegally deprived of some or all of the
  elements of his or her identity, States Parties shall provide appropriate
  assistance and protection, with a view to re-establishing speedily his or her
  identity. This indicator is therefore measured for all children, defined as
  persons under the age of 18. 

  Where births are not registered, children may be unable to obtain a birth
  certificate, which can result in denial of access to public services including
  education, health and social services, despite the human rights obligations of
  States to provide these without discrimination. Lack of registration may also
  result in early marriage or early entry to the labour market, before the child
  has reached the minimum legal age. Registering children at birth is the first
  step in securing their recognition before the law, safeguarding their rights,
  and ensuring that any violation of these rights does not go unnoticed.

indicator_definition: >-
  From UNICEF:  This indicator provides the proportion of children under the age
  of five whose births are reported as being registered with the relevant
  national civil authorities. It is calculated by dividing the number of
  children under the age of five whose births are reported as being registered
  with the relevant national civil authorities by the total number of children
  under the age of five in the population.  From Goal 16 TST Working Group: The
  indicator is calculated as the number of children whose births have been
  registered with a civil authority divided by the total number of children. 
  From UNFPA: Percentage of births that are registered within a certain period
  of time after birth (one month, one year, five years of age) in a civil
  registration and vital statistics system or from household surveys.
method_of_computation: >-
  From UNFPA:  Number of births registered within a given period of time after
  birth (a month, a year, 0-4 years) in a given calendar year / Total number of
  births in a given calendar year  Method of measurement: data should be
  available and could be obtained from civil registration and vital statistics
  systems. Civil registration administrative data could be linked to estimates
  of the expected number of newborns. In countries with deficient CRVS systems,
  data is collected via household surveys (DHS and MICS). Questions are asked
  about registration status of children born in the five years preceding the
  data of the survey. The numerator of this indicator includes children whose
  birth certificate was seen by the interviewer or whose mother or care-taker
  says the birth has been registered. Data are also often presented for other
  age groups such as infants or children under 5 years of age. Method of
  estimation: currently UNICEF produces and publish estimates of birth
  registration for children under five using both CRVS and household surveys
  data. Alternative data sources to be considered are the United Nations
  Demographic Yearbook and the World Population Prospects produced by UNPD-DESA.
  A new methodology and set of procedures need to be put in place to produce the
  desired estimate of birth registration for under one year of age (see
  justifications below).

  Births are registered by state vital registration systems.  Reported births
  are based on 100% of all birth certificates registered in all states and the
  District of Columbia. It is estimated that more than 99 percent of births
  occurring in the UK are registered based on previous results of a national
  test of birth-registration completneness according to place of delivery and
  race.
