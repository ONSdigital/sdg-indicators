rationale_interpretation: "From UNICEF: \n Registering children at birth is the first step in securing their recognition before the law, safeguarding their rights, and ensuring that any violation of these rights does not go unnoticed. \nChildren without official identification documents may be denied health care or education. Later in life, the lack of such documentation can mean that a child may enter into marriage or the labour market, or be conscripted into the armed forces, before the legal age. In adulthood, birth certificates may be required to obtain social assistance or a job in the formal sector, to buy or prove the right to inherit property, to vote and to obtain a passport. \n\n From Goal 16 TST Working Group: \nArticle 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) provides that all children should be registered immediately after birth and have the right from birth to a name and the right to acquire a nationality. Article 8 CRC further provides that, where a child is illegally deprived of some or all of the elements of his or her identity, States Parties shall provide appropriate assistance and protection, with a view to re-establishing speedily his or her identity. This indicator is therefore measured for all children, defined as persons under the age of 18. \nWhere births are not registered, children may be unable to obtain a birth certificate, which can result in denial of access to public services including education, health and social services, despite the human rights obligations of States to provide these without discrimination. Lack of registration may also result in early marriage or early entry to the labour market, before the child has reached the minimum legal age. Registering children at birth is the first step in securing their recognition before the law, safeguarding their rights, and ensuring that any violation of these rights does not go unnoticed."

indicator_name: 'Proportion of children under 5 years of age whose births have been registered with a civil authority, by age'
target: 'By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration.'
indicator_definition: 'From UNICEF:  This indicator provides the proportion of children under the age of five whose births are reported as being registered with the relevant national civil authorities. It is calculated by dividing the number of children under the age of five whose births are reported as being registered with the relevant national civil authorities by the total number of children under the age of five in the population.  From Goal 16 TST Working Group: The indicator is calculated as the number of children whose births have been registered with a civil authority divided by the total number of children.  From UNFPA: Percentage of births that are registered within a certain period of time after birth (one month, one year, five years of age) in a civil registration and vital statistics system or from household surveys.'
method_of_computation: 'From UNFPA:  Number of births registered within a given period of time after birth (a month, a year, 0-4 years) in a given calendar year / Total number of births in a given calendar year  Method of measurement: data should be available and could be obtained from civil registration and vital statistics systems. Civil registration administrative data could be linked to estimates of the expected number of newborns. In countries with deficient CRVS systems, data is collected via household surveys (DHS and MICS). Questions are asked about registration status of children born in the five years preceding the data of the survey. The numerator of this indicator includes children whose birth certificate was seen by the interviewer or whose mother or care-taker says the birth has been registered. Data are also often presented for other age groups such as infants or children under 5 years of age. Method of estimation: currently UNICEF produces and publish estimates of birth registration for children under five using both CRVS and household surveys data. Alternative data sources to be considered are the United Nations Demographic Yearbook and the World Population Prospects produced by UNPD-DESA. A new methodology and set of procedures need to be put in place to produce the desired estimate of birth registration for under one year of age (see justifications below).'

comments_and_limitations: 'Births are registered by state vital registration systems.  Reported births are based on 100% of all birth certificates registered in all states and the District of Columbia. It is estimated that more than 99 percent of births occurring in the US are registered based on previous results of a national test of birth-registration completneness according to place of delivery and race.'
