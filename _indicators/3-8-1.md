method_of_computation: 'Number of people receiving the intervention''/ Number of people who need the intervention Method of measurement Universal health coverage means that people receive the services they need, without incurring financial hardship. Countries progressively realize UHC according to their level of development, epidemiological situation, health system and people''s expectations.''''The indicators ideally cover promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliation. There are a number of indicators that all countries implement such as immunization coverage or skilled attendance at birth that can be used for a summary measure of progress that can be used at lgobal and regional and country levels. Countries however will also create their own set of indicators to track progress towards UHC.'''' The selection of indicators is based on the initial framework, and was applied in the global report published in 2015 by WHO and the World Bank.''''This provides a basis for further improvements working alongside countries. Method of estimation The indicators can be expressed as a summary measure. These can be weighted according to indicator, or intervention area. Work on incorporating an equity component in the summary measure is ongoing but is possible in a relatively simple manner.'
