method_of_computation: >-
  National surveys are structured in 4 components: policies, institutions,
  management tools, and financing. Within each component there are questions
  with defined response options giving scores of 0- 100. Questions scores are
  aggregated to the component level, and each component score is equally
  weighted to give an aggregated indicator score of 0-100. The method builds on
  official UN IWRM status reporting, from 2008 and 2012, of the Johannesburg
  Plan of Implementation from the UN World Summit for Sustainable Development
  (1992).
indicator_definition: >-
  This indicator reflects the extent to which integrated water resources
  management (IWRM) is implemented. It takes into account the various users and
  uses of water with the aim of promoting positive social, economic and
  environmental impacts on all levels, including transboundary, where
  appropriate.
target: >-
  By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels,
  including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate.

rationale_interpretation: >-
  The indicator captures the degree of implementation of all main elements of
  IWRM. It supports decision making at the country level, as results can be
  disaggregated to review progress on different aspects. This will strengthen
  stakeholder participation, transparency and accountability. It also enables
  countries to identify barriers to progress and ways in which they can be
  addressed. It also facilitates coherence between the various targets within
  the water and sanitation goal by supporting water monitoring, planning and
  evaluation, as well as associated capacity building and thus the achievement
  of the overall water goal.

us_method_of_computation: >-
  National Agricultural Statistics Service: Data are derived from the Farm and
  Ranch Irrigation Survey (FRIS) sampled from the Census of Agriculture
  irrigation data. Farm definition: A farm is any place from which $1,000 or
  more of agricultural products were produced and sold, or normally would have
  been sold, during the census or survey year. Acre-feet of water: An acre-foot
  of water is the quantity of water required to cover one acre to a depth of one
  foot. This is equivalent to 43,560 cubic feet or 325,851 gallons. Acres
  irrigated: Acres or area irrigated are the acres of agricultural land to which
  water was applied by any artificial or controlled means such as sprinklers,
  flooding, furrows, ditches, gated pipe, hand watered, capillary mats, trough
  irrigation, ebb-and-flood irrigation, sub-irrigation, and spreader dikes
  including pre-planted, partial, and supplemental irrigation. Land flooded was
  to be included as irrigated only if the water was diverted to agricultural
  land by dams, canals, or other works.
comments_and_limitations: >-
  All Years: Excluded from these data are institutional, research, and
  experimental operations. Data are strictly for water used for irrigation on
  farm land only.  2008: Data does not include non-horticultural land use for
  horticultural operations.    The U.S. Geological Survey conducts a water
  resource census every five years which includes all water use within the
  country http://water.usgs.gov/watercensus/  there is also a water use website
  http://water.usgs.gov/watuse/
periodicity: Every five years
time_period: >-
  Conducted every five years.  Referenced time period is the previous calendar
  year. Data collection period was five months.
