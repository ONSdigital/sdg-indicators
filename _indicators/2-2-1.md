  Prevalence of stunting (height for age <-2 standard deviation from the median
  of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards) among children
  under 5 years of age
target: >-
  By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the
  internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5
  years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant
  and lactating women and older persons.

  Estimates reported for 2014 pertain to pooled 2013 and 2014 NHANES data. The
  estimated percent meets the NCHS standards for reliability and precision. 
  The  standard error for the 2013-14 estimate is 0.51 and the confidence
  interval widths for this estimate is less than 5%.

  The number of children from birth through <5 years with height-for-age more
  than 2 standard deviations below the median length/height-for-age was divided
  by the total number of children from birth through 5 years and the result was
  multiplied by 100.  The numbers and resulting estimate are weighted to be
  nationally representative.  The 2013-2014 NHANES data were merged with the
  expanded WHO growth chart files of length/height-for-age for boys and girls by
  age in days. Age in months at examination on the NHANES 2013-2014 file was
  converted to age in days by multiplying it by 30.4375 and taking the largest
  integer of the result.
