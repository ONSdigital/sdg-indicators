  Prevalence of stunting (height for age <-2 standard deviation from the median
  of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards) among children
  under 5 years of age
target: >-
  By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the
  internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5
  years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant
  and lactating women and older persons.

  Percent of US children from birth up to 5 years with height-for-age less than
  2 standard deviations of the median of the WHO Child Growth Standards.
comments_and_limitations: >-
  The estimated percent meets the NCHS standards for reliability and precision. 
  The  standard error for the 2013-14 estimate is 0.51 and the confidence
  interval widths for this estimate is less than 5%.

us_method_of_computation: >-
  The number of children from birth through <5 years with height-for-age more
  than 2 standard deviations below the median length/height-for-age was divided
  by the total number of children from birth through 5 years and the result was
  multiplied by 100.  The numbers and resulting estimate are weighted to be
  nationally representative.  The 2013-2014 NHANES data were merged with the
  expanded WHO growth chart files of length/height-for-age for boys and girls by
  age in days. Age in months at examination on the NHANES 2013-2014 file was
  converted to age in days by multiplying it by 30.4375 and taking the largest
  integer of the result.
