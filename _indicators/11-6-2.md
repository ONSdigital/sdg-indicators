  Mean or average: Levels of air pollution can vary drastically from day to day
  based on local weather conditions, geography, economic output, etc.
  Articulating the indicator as annual mean is a more specific indicator for
  monitoring the health and environmental impacts of sustainable growth and
  development in cities over time. WHO air quality guidelines provide specific
  recommendations on the mean levels of fine particulate matter which can
  support measuring the per capita health impacts related to any improvements or
  degradation in air quality in cities. Incidents of high air pollution levels
  also have health impacts, but these are less important than longer term
  exposures, and related statistics are less reliable in view of greater
  variability due to external factors, we therefore do recommend a more specific
  articulation of this indicator to as annual means as a way to monitor SDG
  achievement. 

  Fine particulate matter: Fine particulate matter (i.e. PM2.5) can be directly
  linked to estimates of health risks. Coarse particulate matter (i.e. PM10)
  measurements can be converted to PM2.5, but will inherently introduce
  additional uncertainty to estimates of impacts (e.g. health). Articulating
  this indicator to fine particulate matter increases its specificity and its
  relevance for monitoring the health impacts of sustainable development
  policies. 

  Population weighted: The population size of cities vary within a country.
  Weighting annual mean air quality measurements of fine PM by the city
  population size relative to other cities in a country increases the
  suitability and measurability of this indicator at a national scale.
  Furthermore it makes estimating the related impacts on health and other
  sustainable development issues (e.g. improvements in energy efficiency from
  sustainable transport) more feasbile and accurate for monitoring progress.

us_method_of_computation: >-
  Steps for computing the indicator: 1. Retrieved monitor-level annual mean
  values from EPA's Air Quality System. (These annual means are the average of
  the four calendar quarter averages. At least 11 24-hour observations in each
  calendar quarter is required for the annual mean to be valid.  Otherwise it is
  invalid and not used.) 2. The highest annual mean among all monitors in each
  city (using Core Based Statistical Areas as defined by the United States
  Census Bureau) was computed to represent each city. 3. For each city,
  multiplied the maximum annual mean by the 2010 population. 4. Summed this
  population-weighted annual mean across all cities with data. 5. Divided this
  sum by the sum of all cities with data. 6. Resulting value is an average
  population-weighted concentration.
comments_and_limitations: >-
  Note that a constant population (2010) was used.  Note that the number of
  cities that have data can vary from year to year.
