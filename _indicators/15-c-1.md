indicator_name: Proportion of traded wildlife that was poached or illicitly trafficked
target: Enhance global support for efforts to combat poaching and trafficking of protected
  species, including by increasing the capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable
  livelihood opportunities.
indicator_definition: 'The proportion of traded wildlife that was poached or illicitly
  trafficked is defined as the proportion of total wildlife seizures to the total
  wildlife traded as evidenced by export permits issued. The different wildlife products
  traded and seized are compared by applying an aggregation measure. Concepts: Wildlife
  is defined as protected wild species of flora and fauna which are legally traded
  and included in the CITES Appendices. With the exception of Appendix I species,
  most protected wildlife is legally traded. Poaching is defined as the illegal taking
  of wildlife for the purposes of international trade. Illicit trafficking is defined
  as illegal import or export of wildlife. Export Permits are required to export CITES-listed
  wildlife by every Member State (defined in Article VI of CITES, which regulates
  the information export permit shall contain and in Resolution Conf. 8.5, in which
  the Conference of the Parties to the Convention agreed on the information to be
  included in an export permitiv). Seizures are the result of confiscation of wildlife
  or wildlife products by national law enforcement authorities. Seizures occur when
  law enforcement authorities have suspicion that the wildlife or wildlife product
  they encounter is obtained or trafficked illegally. Depending on where, when and
  why national law enforcement authorities seize wildlife and wildlife products, the
  information about the seized items corresponds more or less to the variables defined
  by CITES in the export permit. A minimum prerequisite of a seizure report is naming
  the species (or lowest taxonomic level possible) of the seized specimen. Also the
  quantity of specimens and the unit of measure are ideally included, as well as the
  trade term defining the product that is seized. Aggregation measure. The weight
  and number of seizures cannot be used as an indicator of poaching, because it is
  meaningless to compare or add the different wildlife products. Since legal trade
  does occur among all species products, including those listed on CITES Appendix
  I, it is possible to derive standard prices from import records in a common market
  and to determine, for example, what the relative value of rosewood is as compared
  to dried seahorses.'
