indicator_name: Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels
target: >-
  By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal,
  unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and
  implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in
  the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum
  sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics.
indicator_definition: >-
  The indicator we propose is the "proportion of fish stocks within biologically
  sustainable levels", not limits. It is therefore slightly different from the
  indicator 7.4 currently included in the Millennium Development Goals. The FAO
  Committee on Fisheries has requested changes (see the 2012 and 2014 Reports of
  the 30th and 31st Sessions of the Committee on Fisheries) in the description
  of the status of the stocks based on sustainability to ensure clarify and
  reduce misunderstandings by the general public. The concept of "within
  biologically sustainable levels" means that abundance of the fish stock is at
  or higher than the level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield. We
  estimated 584 fish stocks around world, representing 70% of global landings.
  Each stock was estimated using the method described in FAO Technical Paper
  569. If the stock has abundance below the level that can produce maximum
  sustainable yield, it was counted as overfished. The indicator measures the %
  of the assessed stocks are within biologically sustainable levels.

actual_indicator_available: The Fish Stock Sustainability Index (FSSI)
actual_indicator_available_description: >-
  The FSSI measures the performance of the most important federally-managed
  stocks  that represent 85% of total U.S. catch.
us_method_of_computation: >-
  Stocks are at the sustainable level if abundance ≥ 80% of the abundance at the
  maximum sustainable yield, with the exception of rebuilding stocks, which must
  be at 100%.  Percentage of stocks at sustainable level is calculated by
  dividing the total number of stocks at the sustainable level by the total
  number of FSSI stocks with known stock status / abundance levels.
comments_and_limitations: >-
  1) The Global Metadata indicates that fish stocks are within biologically
  sustainable levels if abundance is at or higher than the level that can
  produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY).  All U.S. federal stocks are
  managed to achieve the sustainability goals of the Magnuson-Stevenson Act,
  including requirements to end overfishing and rebuild, to achieve MSY.  In
  2015, 91% of federally managed stocks were not subject to overfishing and 84%
  were not overfished.  U.S. Metadata indicates that fish stocks are within
  biologically sustainable levels if abundance is at or higher than 80% for
  non-rebuilding stocks (100% for rebuilding stocks) of the level that can
  produce maximum sustainable yield.  2) The Global Metadata reports at the
  United Nations statistical areas by species or species groups, while U.S.
  Metadata reports at the species complex, species, or stock level for U.S.
  managed stocks throughout their range.
