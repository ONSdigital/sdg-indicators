indicator_name: "Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels"
target: "By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics."
indicator_definition: "The indicator we propose is the \"proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels\", not limits. It is therefore slightly different from the indicator 7.4 currently included in the Millennium Development Goals. The FAO Committee on Fisheries has requested changes (see the 2012 and 2014 Reports of the 30th and 31st Sessions of the Committee on Fisheries) in the description of the status of the stocks based on sustainability to ensure clarify and reduce misunderstandings by the general public. The concept of \"within biologically sustainable levels\" means that abundance of the fish stock is at or higher than the level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield. We estimated 584 fish stocks around world, representing 70% of global landings. Each stock was estimated using the method described in FAO Technical Paper 569. If the stock has abundance below the level that can produce maximum sustainable yield, it was counted as overfished. The indicator measures the % of the assessed stocks are within biologically sustainable levels."
