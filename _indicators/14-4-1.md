indicator_name: Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels
target: By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported
  and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based
  management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible,
  at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their
  biological characteristics.
indicator_definition: The indicator we propose is the "proportion of fish stocks within
  biologically sustainable levels", not limits. It is therefore slightly different
  from the indicator 7.4 currently included in the Millennium Development Goals. The
  FAO Committee on Fisheries has requested changes (see the 2012 and 2014 Reports
  of the 30th and 31st Sessions of the Committee on Fisheries) in the description
  of the status of the stocks based on sustainability to ensure clarify and reduce
  misunderstandings by the general public. The concept of "within biologically sustainable
  levels" means that abundance of the fish stock is at or higher than the level that
  can produce the maximum sustainable yield. We estimated 584 fish stocks around world,
  representing 70% of global landings. Each stock was estimated using the method described
  in FAO Technical Paper 569. If the stock has abundance below the level that can
  produce maximum sustainable yield, it was counted as overfished. The indicator measures
  the % of the assessed stocks are within biologically sustainable levels.
