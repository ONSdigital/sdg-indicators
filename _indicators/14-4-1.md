title: Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels

target_id: '14.4'
target: >-
  By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics
indicator_name: Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels

indicator_definition: >-
  The indicator Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels measures the sustainability of
  the world's marine capture fisheries by their abundance. A fish stock of which abundance is at or greater
  than the level, that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically
  sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically
  unsustainable.

  The indicator shows the percentage of fish stocks in seas around the UK that are both harvested sustainably and are at full reproductive capacity.

  The indicator is based on a group of 7 species in 13 fish stocks for which there are reliable estimates of fishing mortality and spawning biomass, together with precautionary reference points for fishing mortality and spawning biomass that allow the sustainability of the stocks to be evaluated. A 'stock' refers to a population of a species occurring in a defined sea area; a particular species may occur in multiple stocks in waters around the UK. The 13 stocks represent a wide range of different stocks and fisheries including demersal roundfish (cod, haddock, saithe), flatfish (sole, plaice) and pelagic (blue whiting and mackerel). The International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) classifies a stock's status by comparing the quantity of mature fish (the spawning stock biomass) and the rate at which the stock is exploited, in relation to agreed reference levels. The stock trends and refernce levekls are obtained from fishery and survey data from each zone.

comments_limitations: >-
  · The indicator has been historically updated and is not directly compariable with previous versions. The indicator is intended to provide a relative trend over time but the absolute value in any year will depend on the mix of stocks.
  · The indicator excludes sharks, skates, shellfish and many other stocks for which data are not adequate to allow estimation of historic biomass and fishing mortality, or for which the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) does not provide precautionary reference points.

Data follows the UN specification for this indicator; however it has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts. As with all indicators, this will be reviewed.
  
The Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at <SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk>
