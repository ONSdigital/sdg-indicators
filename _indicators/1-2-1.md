  Monitoring national poverty is important for country-specific development
  agendas. National poverty lines are used to make more accurate estimates of
  poverty consistent with the country’s specific economic and social
  circumstances, and are not intended for international comparisons of poverty
  rates.
national_indicator_available: Percentage of the population living in households at risk of poverty
national_indicator_description: >-
  The percentage of people who are living in households which are deemed at risk
  of poverty in the national context. Monitoring national poverty is important
  for country-specific development agendas. National poverty lines are used to
  make more accurate estimates of poverty consistent with the country’s specific
  economic and social circumstances, and are not intended for international
  comparisons of poverty rates.

  Metadata (Eurostat).  Household income: The total disposable income of a
  household is calculated by adding together the personal income received by all
  of household members plus income received at household level. Missing income
  information is imputed.  Disposable household income includes i) All income
  from work (employee wages and self-employment earnings), ii) Private income
  from investment and property, iii) Transfers between households, iv) All
  social transfers received in cash including old-age pensions  Note: Some of
  the income components are mandatory only from 2007: Imputed rent, Interest
  paid on mortgage, and v) Employer's social insurance contributions. From the
  2007 year on, all countries have to supply gross income information. The
  current definition of total household disposable income used for the
  calculation of EU-SILC based indicators excludes i) Imputed rent - i.e. money
  that one saves on full (market) rent by living in one's own accommodation or
  in accommodation rented at a price that is lower than the market rent, and ii)
  Non monetary income components, in particular value of goods produced for own
  consumption, social transfers in kind and non-cash employee income except
  company cars. * Equivalence scale: To take into account the impact of
  differences in household size and composition, the total disposable household
  income is "equivalised". The equivalised income attributed to each member of
  the household is calculated by dividing the total disposable income of the
  household by the equivalisation factor. Equivalisation factors can be
  determined in various ways. Eurostat applies an equivalisation factor
  calculated according to the OECD-modified scale first proposed in 1994 - which
  gives a weight of 1.0 to the first person aged 14 or more, a weight of 0.5 to
  other persons aged 14 or more and a weight of 0.3 to persons aged 0-13. 
  Household: A 'private household' means "a person living alone or a group of
  people who live together in the same private dwelling and share expenditures,
  including the joint provision of the essentials of living". EU-SILC
  implementing regulation number 1983/2003 on updated definitions, defines
  households in terms of sharing household expenses and (for non-permanent
  members) in terms of duration of stay and (for temporarily absent members) in
  terms of duration of absence.
