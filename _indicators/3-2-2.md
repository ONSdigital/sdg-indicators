title: Neonatal mortality rate

target_id: '3.2'
target: >-
  By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births
indicator_name: Neonatal mortality rate

indicator_definition: >-
  Probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the first 28 completed days of life if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. Neonatal deaths (deaths among live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late neonatal deaths, occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day of life.

computation_definitions: >-
  Neonatal death is the death of a child of when the age of the child is under 28 days. Early neonatal death is under the age of 7 days, late neonatal is between 7 and 27 days, postnatal is between 28 days and 1 year and infant death is classified as under 1 year.   Socio-economic status is defined as the social status of a person based on their occupation, income and education.   Type of registration refers to the address status of the parents, and shows whether they are living together or separately.
computation_calculations: >-
  No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator. For insight into the details of potential calculations please refer to the original source metadata or source contact. A basic summary of the concept  behind the formation of the indicator is as follows:  The number of neonatal deaths divided by the number of births in the same time period and this will be multiplied by 1,000 to get a rate that gives a figure per thousand births.
computation_numerator: Number of neonatal deaths x 100

computation_denominator: Number of live births

computation_disaggregation: >-
  This data can be broken down into; age, birth weight, place of usual residence, sex by country of occurrence, socio-economic status by type of marital status, type of registration, England and Wales, England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland. These regions can be broken down into English and Welsh regions.  English regions;  North East, North West, Yorkshire and The Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England, London South East (south east coast 2008), South West, South Central ( 2008).  Welsh regions; Betsi Cadwaladr University, Powys Teaching, Hywel Dda University, Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University, Cwm Taf University, Aneurin Bevan University, Cardiff and Vale University.
comments_limitations: >-
  The headline figures for this indicator cover the United Kingdom however the disaggregation for this indicator do not cover England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland they only cover England and Wales jointly. The exception to this is when regions of England and the regions of Wales are specified. Although the headline figures go back to 2000 for neonatal, early neonatal, post neonatal, and infant other disaggregation for the indicator only go as far back as 2008.   The disaggregation of socio-economic status is only shown by type of marital status and type of registration. The classification used for socio-economic status is the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification.
