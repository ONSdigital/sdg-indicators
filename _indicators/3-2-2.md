indicator: 3.2.2
method_of_computation: >-
  Number of children who died during the first 28 days of life / Number of live
  births Method of measurement Data from civil registration: The number of live
  births and the number of neonatal deaths are used to calculate age_ specific
  rates. This system provides annual data. Data from household surveys:
  Calculations are based on full birth history, whereby women are asked for the
  date of birth of each of their children, whether each child is still alive and
  if not the age at death. Method of estimation The United Nation Inter_agency
  Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN_IGME) produces neonatal mortality
  rate estimates with a Bayesian spline regression model which models the ratio
  of neonatal mortality rate / (under_five mortality rate'_'neonatal mortality
  rate). Estimates of NMR are obtained by recombining the estimates of the ratio
  with UN IGME_estimated under_five mortality rate. See UN IGME for more
  details. Predominant type of statistics: adjusted and estimated. These
  neonatal mortality rates have been estimated by applying methods to the
  available data from all Member States in order to ensure comparability across
  countries and time; hence they are not necessarily the same as the official
  national data.
indicator_definition: >-
  Probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the
  first 28 completed days of life if subject to age_specific mortality rates of
  that period, expressed per 1000 live births. Neonatal deaths (deaths among
  live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into
  early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late
  neonatal deaths, occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day
  of life.
target: >-
  By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age,
  with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as
  12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per
  1,000 live births.

  No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as
  appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this
  indicator. For insight into the details of potential calculations please refer
  to the original source metadata or source contact. A basic summary of the
  concept  behind the formation of the indicator is as follows:  The number of
  neonatal deaths divided by the number of births in the same time period and
  this will be multiplied by 1,000 to get a rate that gives a figure per
  thousand births.

  The headline data for this indicator provides geographical coverage of the
  whole United Kingdom, this can be disaggregated by country, but a regional
  breakdown is only available for England and Wales.   Socio-economic status is
  only available under a specified type of registration; it is not available as
  a standalone disaggregation. The classification used for socio-economic status
  follows the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification.

computation_definitions: >-
  Neonatal death is the death of a child of when the age of the child is under
  28 days. Early neonatal death is under the age of 7 days, late neonatal is
  between 7 and 27 days, postnatal is between 28 days and 1 year and infant
  death is classified as under 1 year.

  Socio-economic status is defined as the social status of a person based on
  their occupation, income and education.

  Type of registration refers to the address status of the parents, and shows
  whether they are living together or separately.
