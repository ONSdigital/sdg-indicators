indicator: 3.2.2
indicator_definition: Probability that a child born in a specific year or period will
  die during the first 28 completed days of life if subject to age_specific mortality
  rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. Neonatal deaths (deaths among
  live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into early
  neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late neonatal deaths,
  occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day of life.
target: By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of
  age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as
  12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000
  live births.

computation_calculations: 'No calculations were performed in the data acquisition
  of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format
  specified by this indicator. For insight into the details of potential calculations
  please refer to the original source metadata or source contact. A basic summary
  of the concept  behind the formation of the indicator is as follows:  The number
  of neonatal deaths divided by the number of births in the same time period and this
  will be multiplied by 1,000 to get a rate that gives a figure per thousand births. '

comments_limitations: The headline data for this indicator provides geographical coverage
  of the whole United Kingdom, this can be disaggregated by country, but a regional
  breakdown is only available for England and Wales.   Socio-economic status is only
  available under a specified type of registration; it is not available as a standalone
  disaggregation. The classification used for socio-economic status follows the National
  Statistics Socio-economic Classification.

computation_definitions: |-
  Neonatal death is the death of a child of when the age of the child is under 28 days. Early neonatal death is under the age of 7 days, late neonatal is between 7 and 27 days, postnatal is between 28 days and 1 year and infant death is classified as under 1 year.
  Socio-economic status is defined as the social status of a person based on their occupation, income and education.
  Type of registration refers to the address status of the parents, and shows whether they are living together or separately.
