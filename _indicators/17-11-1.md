indicator_name: Developing countries' and least developed countries' share of global
  exports
target: Significantly increase the exports of developing countries, in particular
  with a view to doubling the least developed countries' share of global exports by
  2020.
indicator_definition: 'From ITC, UNCTAD, WTO:This indicator provides calculations
  of developing and LDCs exports of goods and services toward the rest of the World.
  The unit of measurement could be in % (developing countries'' and LDCs share of
  global exports) or alternatively in value (i.e. USD ''000). Alternatively, and in
  order to reflect the dual purpose of the target (i.e. increase of developing countries
  exports / doubling the LDCs share for global exports) 2 different indicators can
  be calculated out of the same data, namely: (1) least developed countries'' share
  of global exports (in % terms), (2) exports of developing countries (in value terms).
  The indicator will not include export of oil and arms. From UPU:  Developing countries
  and LDCs'' e-commerce flows at the export level (volumes and/or values, and by product):
  this indicator would be a volume or value index of international e-commerce flows
  from developing countries and LDCs to the rest of the world. International postal
  and parcel flows would be a proxy for international e-commerce flows since the ecommerce
  ecosystem heavily relies on the international postal and express infrastructure
  to transport ecommerce-related shipments.'
