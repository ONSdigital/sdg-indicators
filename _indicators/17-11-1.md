rationale_interpretation: "From ITC, UNCTAD, WTO:\nThe indicator is self-explanatory and measures precisely what is required by the target.\n\n From UPU: \n E-commerce is likely to represent a significant share of international trade transactions by 2030. In order to avoid an e-commerce divide between developing and developed countries, trade policies must fully take into account this irreversible phenomenon. Moreover, international e-commerce will play an essential development role for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the coming two decades, particularly for those interested in internationalizing their activities."

indicator_name: 'Developing countries'' and least developed countries'' share of global exports'
target: 'Significantly increase the exports of developing countries, in particular with a view to doubling the least developed countries'' share of global exports by 2020.'
indicator_definition: 'From ITC, UNCTAD, WTO:This indicator provides calculations of developing and LDCs exports of goods and services toward the rest of the World. The unit of measurement could be in % (developing countries'' and LDCs share of global exports) or alternatively in value (i.e. USD ''000). Alternatively, and in order to reflect the dual purpose of the target (i.e. increase of developing countries exports / doubling the LDCs share for global exports) 2 different indicators can be calculated out of the same data, namely: (1) least developed countries'' share of global exports (in % terms), (2) exports of developing countries (in value terms). The indicator will not include export of oil and arms. From UPU:  Developing countries and LDCs'' e-commerce flows at the export level (volumes and/or values, and by product): this indicator would be a volume or value index of international e-commerce flows from developing countries and LDCs to the rest of the world. International postal and parcel flows would be a proxy for international e-commerce flows since the ecommerce ecosystem heavily relies on the international postal and express infrastructure to transport ecommerce-related shipments.'
