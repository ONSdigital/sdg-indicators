  From UNESCO: The indicator is a direct measure of the skill levels of youth
  and adults in the two areas. From OECD: Provide estimates of the level and
  distribution of key information processing skills among the adult population
  and better understand the links between these skills and their antecedents and
  outcomes.

actual_indicator_available_description: "PIAAC measures literacy and numeracy in both paper and computer modes. Items that measure problem solving in technology-rich environments are only computer-administered. Reading components tasks are only administered in the paper-and-pencil mode. All participating countries are required to assess the literacy and numeracy domains, but the problem solving and reading components domains are both optional. The United States assessed all four domains. PIAAC tasks developed for all four domains are authentic, culturally appropriate, and drawn from real-life situations that are expected to be of importance or relevance in different contexts. Tasks' contents and questions are intended to reflect the purposes of adults' daily lives across cultures, even if they are not necessarily familiar to all adults in all countries.
