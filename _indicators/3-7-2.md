  From Population Division/DESA, United Nations: 

  The birth rate among adolescents younger than age 15 is more meaningfully
  measured for ages 12-14 as births among 10-11 year olds are rare and a rate
  with respect to the 10-14 year old population would not correctly reflect the
  increased risk of early childbearing by age.

  By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care
  services, including for family planning, information and education, and the
  integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes.
indicator_definition: >-
  From WHO: Annual number of births to women aged 15-19 years per 1000 women in
  that age group. It is also referred to as the age_specific fertility rate for
  women aged 15-19 years. From Population Division/DESA, United Nations:
  Metadata on the definition, method of computation and other information for
  the adolescent birth (15- 19) are included in the MDG database as this was an
  indicator (5.4) used for global monitoring of MDG target 5.B. Achieve, by
  2015, universal access to reproductive health. Please see
  http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx The definition and method of
  computation for the birth rate among 10-14 year olds are similar to that for
  the birth rate among 15-19 year olds.
method_of_computation: >-
  From WHO: Number of live births to women aged 15-19 years / Exposure to
  childbearing by women aged 15-19 years Method of measurement The adolescent
  birth rate is generally computed as a ratio. The numerator is the number of
  live births to women aged 15-19 years, and the denominator is an estimate of
  exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years. The numerator and the
  denominator are calculated differently for civil registration and survey and
  census data. Civil registration: In the case of civil registration the
  numerator is the registered number of live births born to women aged 15-19
  years during a given year, and the denominator is the estimated or enumerated
  population of women aged 15-19 years.'' Survey data: In the case of survey
  data, the adolescent birth rate is generally computed on the basis of
  retrospective birth histories. The numerator refers to births to women who
  were 15-19 years of age at the time of the birth during a reference period
  before the interview, and the denominator to person_years lived between the
  ages of 15 and 19 years by the interviewed women during the same reference
  period. Whenever possible, the reference period corresponds to the five years
  preceding the survey. The reported observation year corresponds to the middle
  of the reference period. For some surveys, no retrospective birth histories
  are available and the estimate is based on the date of last birth or the
  number of births in the 12 months preceding the survey.'' Census data: With
  census data, the adolescent birth rate is generally computed on the basis of
  the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the
  enumeration. The census provides both the numerator and the denominator for
  the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for
  under_registration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some countries
  with no other reliable data, the own_children method of indirect estimation
  provides estimates of the adolescent birth rate for a number of years before
  the census (See: http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx, accessed 19
  October 2009.) If numbers are available, adolescent fertility at ages under 15
  years can also be computed. Method of estimation The United Nations Population
  Division compiles and updates data on adolescent fertility rates for MDG
  monitoring. Estimates based on civil registration are provided when the
  country reports at least 90% coverage and there is reasonable agreement
  between civil registration estimates and survey estimates. Survey estimates
  are provided only when there is no reliable civil registration. Given the
  restrictions of the United Nations MDG database, only one source is provided
  by year and country. In such cases precedence is given to the survey programme
  conducted most frequently at the country level, with other survey programmes
  using retrospective birth histories, census and other surveys in that order.
