indicator_name: 'Number of countries with laws and regulations that guarantee women aged 15-49 access to sexual and reproductive health care, information and education'
target: 'Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences.'
indicator_definition: 'From UN-WOMEN: Legal/regulatory frameworks covered by this indicator include laws and regulations that explicitly guarantee: 1. Access to SRH services without third party authorization (from the spouse, guardian, parents or others); 2. Access to SRH services without restrictions in terms of age and marital status; 3. Access by adolescents to SRH information and education. Note: the indicator also measures the absence of laws that prohibit or restrict access to SRH services From UNFPA:  This indicator measures the proportion of countries with laws and regulations that guarantee women and adolescents access to sexual and reproductive health services, information and education irrespective of age, marital status and without third party authorization.From UNFPA:  This indicator measures the proportion of countries with laws and regulations that guarantee women and adolescents access to sexual and reproductive health services, information and education irrespective of age, marital status and without third party authorization.'

method_of_computation: "From UN-WOMEN: Denominator: All Member States, for federal states this will be reflected in central governments' self-reporting.  Sources of information and methodology: The suggested methodology consists of initial self-reporting by governments through a detailed survey to be developed based on the indicators below with detailed questions that safeguard the replicability and reliability of state responses. This procedure was applied for the ICPD+20 review survey with support to governments from UNFPA's country offices where needed. The self-reported data will undergo validation and qualitative assessment by responsible UN agencies assigned to the task. At this stage other stakeholders and data sources could be consulted, e.g. National Human Rights Institutions, human rights treaty bodies or other international, regional or national monitoring bodies. From UNFPA:  Methodology and feasibility of data collection \tThe indicator will measure the number of countries with legal and regulatory frameworks guaranteeing access to sexual and reproductive services, education and information without any of the above restrictions. Therefore, to count as a \"yes\" all the four requirements included in this indicator will need to be met: (i) access without third party authorization; (ii) access without age restrictions; (iii) access irrespective of marital status; and (iv) access to education and information at all levels. For countries counting as \"no\", nevertheless, data will be disaggregated in accordance to each of those requirements to be able to measure progress on each particular front. Sources of information and methodology: \tThe suggested methodology consists of initial self-reporting by governments through a detailed survey to be developed based on the indicators below with detailed questions that safeguard the replicability and reliability of state responses. This procedure was successfully applied for the ICPD+20 review survey with support to governments from UNFPA's country offices where needed. \tInformation provided by States can be complemented with information from UN treaty monitoring bodies, including the Committee on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. These three committees are systematically collecting information and issuing recommendations to State parties on all the issues covered by this indicator. A combined use of these three committees as sources of information will ensure near universal coverage of States and will also increase the periodicity of information. \tMoreover, other actors with a monitoring role such as regional human rights mechanisms, national human rights institutions and civil society organizations often provide information on the components covered by this indicator. UN agencies such as WHO, UNFPA and UN Women also compile country specific information on legal and regulatory developments on issues pertaining to their respective mandates."
