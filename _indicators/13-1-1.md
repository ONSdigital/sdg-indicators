  The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2013 calls for national
  governments to adopt and implement national DRR strategies with their own
  targets, indicators and timeframes. 

  Impacts of climate change on sustainable development are observed through both
  slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean
  acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and
  forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification) and extreme
  weather events. 

  Cities around the world, as well as rural populations, witness growing
  disaster risks. Impacts of climate change on sustainable development are
  observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing
  temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts,
  salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and
  desertification) and extreme weather events. 

  Cities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned
  urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate
  infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and
  hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas
  are urbanized and 21 of the worlds 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones.
  SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal
  flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due
  to the undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development
  combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and
  inadequate capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to
  unsustainable coping strategies and mechanisms. 

  Large numbers of people remain perilously close to falling into poverty,
  experiencing shocks that they are unable to cope with. For the poor, a shock
  of even a relatively short impact and duration can have long term
  consequences. Several dimensions of poverty are closely related to
  environment, which is often affected by natural disasters. Better management
  of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by
  both reducing the likelihood of natural hazard events and offering resources
  to help cope with them. 

  These challenges require enhanced vulnerability and impact assessments,
  mitigation and adaptation plans, resilience building and DRR strategies. It is
  necessary to adapt to climate change, enhance resilience of ecosystems, and
  reduce disaster risk and build resilience to natural disasters. 

  Proactive DRR strategies will address climate change impact and enhance
  resilience of nations. Resilient infrastructures will be critical part of such
  strategies because infrastructures such as health, education, road and other
  critical infrastructures will have direct impact on reducing inequality and
  making growth more inclusive. 

  Increasing number of national governments that adopt and implement national
  DRR strategies will contribute to sustainable development from economic,
  environmental and social perspectives. 

  The indicator will build bridge between the SDGs and the Sendai Framework for
  DRR because the adoption of national DRR strategies is one of Sendai Framework
  targets and will be also monitored under the Sendai Framework Monitoring
  System.

indicator_name: Number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies
target: >-
  Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and
  natural disasters in all countries.
indicator_definition: "National DRR strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030: national disaster risk reduction strategies and plans, across different timescales with targets, indicators and time frames, aimed at preventing the creation of risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening of economic, social, health and environmental resilience (Sendai Framework, para 27(b)). In the Sendai Framework, link with DRR and climate change adaptation is strongly advocated. Note: the DRR strategies need to be based on risk information and assessments. Country: A nation with its own government, occupying a particular territory \tNote: Terminology will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction."
