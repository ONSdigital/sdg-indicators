indicator_name: "Percentage of population with access to electricity"
target: "By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services."
indicator_definition: "The percentage of the population that has access to electricity, based on national household surveys. Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, a number of countries have gaps in available data. To develop the historical evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a simple modeling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points - around 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2012. This modeling approach allowed the estimation of electrification rates for 212 countries over these time periods. The SE4ALL Global Tracking Framework Report (2013) referenced below provides more details on the suggested methodology for tracking access to energy (Chapter 2, Section 1, page 82-87)."
