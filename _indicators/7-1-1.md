  Access to electricity addresses major critical issues in all the dimensions of
  sustainable development. The target has a wide range of social and economic
  impacts, including facilitating development of household-based income
  generating activities and lightening the burden of household tasks.

indicator_name: Proportion of population with access to electricity
target: >-
  By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy
  services.
indicator_definition: >-
  The percentage of the population that has access to electricity, based on
  national household surveys. Given the low frequency and the regional
  distribution of some surveys, a number of countries have gaps in available
  data. To develop the historical evolution and starting point of
  electrification rates, a simple modeling approach was adopted to fill in the
  missing data points - around 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2012. This modeling approach
  allowed the estimation of electrification rates for 212 countries over these
  time periods. The SE4ALL Global Tracking Framework Report (2013) referenced
  below provides more details on the suggested methodology for tracking access
  to energy (Chapter 2, Section 1, page 82-87).

  Percentage of households indicating that they use electricity in the national
  sample of the American Housing Survey.

  Weighted Frequency of sample units answering 'yes' to whether the household
  uses electricity (variable USELECT), divided  by total households.  Weight is
