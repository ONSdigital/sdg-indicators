indicator_name: Proportion of population with access to electricity
target: By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy
  services
indicator_definition: The percentage of the population that has access to electricity,
  based on national household surveys. Given the low frequency and the regional distribution
  of some surveys, a number of countries have gaps in available data. To develop the
  historical evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a simple modeling
  approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points - around 1990, 2000, 2010
  and 2012. This modeling approach allowed the estimation of electrification rates
  for 212 countries over these time periods. The SE4ALL Global Tracking Framework
  Report (2013) referenced below provides more details on the suggested methodology
  for tracking access to energy (Chapter 2, Section 1, page 82-87).
