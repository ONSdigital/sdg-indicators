  as a proportion of the national budgets and GDP
target: By 2020, develop and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment

indicator_definition: This indicator represents the total public expenditure in social
  protection and employment programmes expressed as a percentage of the national budget
  and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It also includes the collective bargaining
  coverage rate, which is calculated as the percentage of employees whose pay and
  conditions of employment are determined by one or more collective agreements. A
  collective bargaining agreement refers to "all agreements in writing regarding working
  conditions and terms of employment concluded between an employer, a group of employers
  or one or more employers' organizations, on the one hand, and one or more representative
  workers' organizations, on the other" (ILO Collective Agreements Recommendation,
  1951).
