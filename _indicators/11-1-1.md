  This indicator uses urban dwellings failing decent homes criteria as an approximation for ‘slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing’ as defined in UN global metadata. Homes failing the current minimum standard are those posing a Category 1 hazard under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS).  From 2008 the survey is able to provide estimates  based on 26 of the 29 hazards, however to maintain consistency and avoid a break in the time series decent homes estimates will be based on 15 hazards.  Estimates for the HHSRS in this report not related to Decent Homes are based on 26 hazards.

  No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator. For insight into the details of potential calculations please refer to the original source metadata or source contact.
