indicator_name: 'Prevalence of malnutrition (weight for height >+2 or <-2 standard deviation from the median of the WHO Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age, by type (wasting and overweight)'
target: 'By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons.'

actual_indicator_available: 'Percent of children under 5 years with weight-for-height/length <2 standard deviations below (wasting) or >2 standard deviations above (overweight) the median weight-for-length/height '
comments_and_limitations: 'The estimates for percent wasting and overweight met the NCHS standards for reliability and precision and the confidence interval width for both estimates was less than 5 percent.  The standard error for the wasting estimate was 0.27 and for the overweight estimate was 1.11.'
us_method_of_computation: 'The 2013-2014 NHANES data were merged with the expanded WHO growth chart files of weight-for-length/height for boys and girls by age. For the wasting estimate, the number of children 5 and younger with weight-for-length/height 2 or more standard deviations below the median weight-for-length/height was divided by the total number of children from birth through 5 years and the result was multiplied by 100. For the overweight estimate, the number of children with weight-for-length/height 2 or more standard deviations above the median weight-for-length/height was divided by the total number of children from birth through 5 years and the result was multiplied by 100. The numbers and resulting estimates are weighted to be nationally representative.'
