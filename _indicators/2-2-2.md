  Prevalence of malnutrition (weight for height >+2 or <-2 standard deviation
  from the median of the WHO Child Growth Standards) among children under 5
  years of age, by type (wasting and overweight)
target: >-
  By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the
  internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5
  years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant
  and lactating women and older persons.

  Percent of children under 5 years with weight-for-height/length <2 standard

  median weight-for-length/height 
comments_and_limitations: >-
  Estimates reported for 2014 pertain to the 2013-2014 pooled NHANES data. The
  estimates for percent wasting and overweight met the NCHS standards for
  reliability and precision and the confidence interval width for both estimates
  was less than 5 percent.  The standard error for the wasting estimate was 0.27
  and for the overweight estimate was 1.11.
us_method_of_computation: >-
  The 2013-2014 NHANES data were merged with the expanded WHO growth chart files
  of weight-for-length/height for boys and girls by age. For the wasting
  estimate, the number of children 5 and younger with weight-for-length/height 2
  or more standard deviations below the median weight-for-length/height was
  divided by the total number of children from birth through 5 years and the
  result was multiplied by 100. For the overweight estimate, the number of
  children with weight-for-length/height 2 or more standard deviations above the
  median weight-for-length/height was divided by the total number of children
  from birth through 5 years and the result was multiplied by 100. The numbers
  and resulting estimates are weighted to be nationally representative.
