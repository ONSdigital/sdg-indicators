rationale_interpretation: 'Migrant workers often pay recruitment agencies sums amounting to several months'' expected wage. This contravenes the ILO Private Employment Agencies Convention commitment to abolish such fees. These fees disproportionately affect low-skilled, lowincome workers from low-income countries. By reducing recruitment costs the disposable incomes of low-income workers are increased and inequalities are reduced by enabling people who could otherwise not afford to seek employment abroad to do so without ending up in debt bondage.'
