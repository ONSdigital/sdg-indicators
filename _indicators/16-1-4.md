  The results are based on telephone interviews with a random sample of adults,
  age 18 +, living in the U.S. The interviews are conducted with respondents on
  landline telephones and cell phones with a minimum quota of 50% cell phone and
  50% landlines respondents, with additional quota by region. Phone numbers are
  selected using random digit dial methods. Landline respondents are chosen at
  random within each household based on the adult with the most recent birthday.
  Samples are weighted to correct for unequal probability of selection,
  non-response, and double coverage of landline and cell users in two sampling
  frames. All estimates are subject to sampling error. Each year, the margin of
  error is approximately +/- 4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.

  The National Crime Victimization Survey, conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau
  for the Bureau of Justice Statistics, does not collect this information;
  however, as part of methodological work for the NCVS redesign, the BJS is
  conducting the American Crime Survey. The survey includes an item similar to
  that used by Gallup: Is there any place within a mile of your home where you
  would be afraid to walk alone at night? [ ] Yes   [ ] No. The companion survey
  is a mail survey, self-administered (with a split sample of about 200,000 to
  determine appropriate placement). For more detail, see the OMB clearance
  package:
  https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewDocument?ref_nbr=201502-1121-001. The
  field test is nearing completion, with a report expected in the fall of 2017.
