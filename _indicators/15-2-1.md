rationale_interpretation: "The definition of SFM by UN GA contains several key aspects, notably that sustainable forest management is a concept which varies over time and between countries, whose circumstances ' ecological, social and economic ' vary widely, but that it should always address a wide range of forest values, including economic, social and environmental values, and take intergenerational equity into account. \nClearly a simple measure of change in forest area, while essential, and used for target 15.1, is insufficient to monitor sustainable forest management as a whole. The index proposed combines the two indicators at present under consideration (\"forest loss\" and \"area certified\") with measures of use/degradation (sub-indicator 2), biodiversity conservation (sub-indicator 3) to give a more rounded picture of sustainable forest management. Further \"topical\" sub-indicators will be needed to provide a more comprehensive assessment of SFM aspects. The significance of the four sub-indicators may be briefly explained as follows: \n\t1. Trends in forest area are crucial for monitoring SFM: clearly, if there is significant uncontrolled deforestation, forest management is not sustainable. The indicator focuses on change as there is no ideal share of forest in land cover, as the share is determined by history, ecological circumstances and competing land uses. The indicator covers the net effect of the other parts of Target 15.2: \"halt deforestation\" and \"substantially increase afforestation and reforestation\". However most countries have reliable data on the components of this overall trend (deforestation, afforestation and reforestation), for which separate targets can be specified, if so desired. This component incorporates the concept of \"net permanent forest loss \" at present classified \"green\" and is also used for Target 15.1 \n\t2. Changes in the stock of biomass are determined by the balance between increase in volume of wood biomass (annual increment) and decrease (natural losses and damage by fire insects etc., and wood harvest). In a sustainably managed forest, increment is more than losses, so that the biomass stock increases, or does not decrease, and carbon is sequestered from the atmosphere. With very few exceptions, a decline in total biomass stocks, even if the forest area does not decrease, implies unsustainable management (and possible degradation). As the wood/carbon ratio is constant, there will be exactly the same trends for carbon stocks as for wood biomass. Therefore a single indicator addresses carbon stocks and flows and trends in growing stock of wood, and may be expressed in m3 of wood or in tons of carbon. \n\t3. Forest areas managed for the conservation of biodiversity are a proxy for trends in forest biodiversity and a clear indication of political will to incorporate biodiversity into forest management. The CBD Aichi Target 11 calls for each country to conserve at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas, so this may be taken as a goal for this element. Work is in hand on developing a number of indicators of forest biodiversity, which may be useful in the future. \n\t4. The fourth parameter looks at the area within a country where a key tool for sustainable forest management is applied. The existence of a \"forest management plan\" is a necessary tool for evidence based, long term management. Those areas that are certified by third party schemes as being sustainably managed work on the basis of an independently verified management plan. While the latter fulfils a higher standard, it should be pointed out that there are very significant areas of sustainably managed forest which are not certified, either because their owners have chosen not to seek certification (which is voluntary and market-based) or because no credible (or affordable) certification scheme is in place for that area. The latter is true for most tropical countries. For this reason, using \"area of certified forest\" as the sole indicator could give a misleading impression."

target: 'By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally.'
indicator_definition: "Sustainable forest management is a central concept for Goal 15 and target 15.1 as well as for target 15.2. It has been formally defined, by the UN General Assembly, as follows: [a] dynamic and evolving concept [that] aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social and environmental values of all types of forests, for the benefit of present and future generations\". (Resolution A/RES/62/98) An \"index of sustainable forest management\" with four sub-indicators can be used as a basic indicator of progress towards sustainable forest management by a country. The four sub-indicators are \t1. Annual average percent change in forest area over most recent available 5 year period \t2. Annual average percent change in stock of carbon in above ground biomass over most recent available 5 year period \t3. Share of forest area whose primary designated function is biodiversity conservation, most recent period \t4. Share of forest area under a forest management plan, of which forest area certified under an independent forest management certification scheme, most recent period For each of these components, countries can set national targets, monitor and report on progress. The four sub-indicators will be combined into a single composite index, but targets would be set at the level of sub-indicators. Once targets have been set by national authorities, in terms of the four sub-indicators, and progress measured over an agreed period, countries would assess progress (on track to exceed target, on track to achieve target, progress but at an insufficient rate, no significant overall progress, moving away from target). The final value of the index would be a simple arithmetic average of the values for the four sub-indicators. The use of national targets allows each country to define sustainable forest management for its own specific circumstances, within a coherent international framework. Targets on the sub-indicators can also be set at regional or global levels."
