indicator_name: Number of jobs in tourism industries as a proportion of total jobs
  and growth rate of jobs, by sex
target: By 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that
  creates jobs and promotes local culture and products.
indicator_definition: 'The "tourism industries", or tourism characteristic industries,
  comprise all establishments for which the principal activity is a tourism characteristic
  activity, i.e. the activities that typically produce tourism characteristic products
  (IRTS 2008 paras. 5.10-5.11). For international comparability purposes these are
  (according to ISIC Rev. 4 categories): accommodation for visitors (5510, 5520, 5590,
  6810 and 6820), food and beverage serving activities (5610, 5629 and 5630), railway
  passenger transport (4911), road passenger transport (4922), water passenger transport
  (5011 and 5021), air passenger transport (5110), transport equipment rental (7710),
  travel agencies and other reservation service activities (7911, 7912 and 7990),
  cultural activities (9000, 9102, 9103), and sport and recreational activities (7721,
  9200, 9311, 9319, 9321 and 9329). Regarding jobs, the agreement between an employee
  and the employer defines a job and each self-employed person has a job. The number
  of jobs in the economy thus exceeds the number of persons employed to the extent
  that some employees have more than one job (SNA 2008 para. 19.30 in IRTS 2008 Compilation
  Guide para. 7.6). Consequently, the number of jobs (demand side) and the number
  of persons employed (supply side) are dissimilar categories and therefore usually
  do not match. In this respect, it should be noted that employment in the tourism
  industries refers to all the jobs (in all occupations) in both tourism-characteristic
  activities and non-tourism-characteristic activities in all establishments in tourism
  industries19. The indicator shows the relative importance of jobs in the tourism
  industries as a share of the economy''s total jobs.'
