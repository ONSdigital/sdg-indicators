rationale_interpretation: "Rationale \nTarget 8.9 has several dimensions but the essence of the target seems to be on promoting sustainable tourism [that ...]. It is recognized that the suggested indicator does not cater to all dimensions of the target, but finding one indicator that would do so seems unviable, certainly over the short-medium term. \nThere is the added challenge that the concept \"sustainable tourism\" is mainly a policy construct and not defined nor part of an established or internationally conceptual/statistical framework at this point. Even though UNWTO together with a number of countries, UNSD and OECD, and counting on the support of the UNCEEA are putting put in motion an initiative towards developing the measurement of the relationship between tourism and sustainability, notably through linking SEEA and TSA, it seems that the production of internationally comparable data on (something that could approximate for) \"sustainable tourism\" in a significant number of countries still has some years to go. \nFor the meantime, the suggested indicator (in its two parts, on tourism related GDP and jobs) seems to be a sensible approximation because (a) it is a good conceptual fit to some key dimensions of the target (b) it stems from a systems approach and is based on sound internationally agreed methodology, and (c) there is a significant number of countries already producing data for this indicator. In addition, the suggested indicator (tourism related GDP and jobs) is in line with Goal 8's general focus on economic growth and employment. \nFinally, the TDGDP/GDP part of this indicator can complement Target 14.7's indicator: \"Fisheries as a % of GDP\" in order to cater to tourism dimension of this target. \n\n Interpretation \n Target 8.9 has several dimensions; this caters to the dimension: tourism that creates jobs. It could also give an indication on how successful the \"promotion\" of tourism as job creator is being: promote [...] tourism that creates jobs."

target: 'By 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products.'
indicator_definition: 'The "tourism industries", or tourism characteristic industries, comprise all establishments for which the principal activity is a tourism characteristic activity, i.e. the activities that typically produce tourism characteristic products (IRTS 2008 paras. 5.10-5.11). For international comparability purposes these are (according to ISIC Rev. 4 categories): accommodation for visitors (5510, 5520, 5590, 6810 and 6820), food and beverage serving activities (5610, 5629 and 5630), railway passenger transport (4911), road passenger transport (4922), water passenger transport (5011 and 5021), air passenger transport (5110), transport equipment rental (7710), travel agencies and other reservation service activities (7911, 7912 and 7990), cultural activities (9000, 9102, 9103), and sport and recreational activities (7721, 9200, 9311, 9319, 9321 and 9329). Regarding jobs, the agreement between an employee and the employer defines a job and each self-employed person has a job. The number of jobs in the economy thus exceeds the number of persons employed to the extent that some employees have more than one job (SNA 2008 para. 19.30 in IRTS 2008 Compilation Guide para. 7.6). Consequently, the number of jobs (demand side) and the number of persons employed (supply side) are dissimilar categories and therefore usually do not match. In this respect, it should be noted that employment in the tourism industries refers to all the jobs (in all occupations) in both tourism-characteristic activities and non-tourism-characteristic activities in all establishments in tourism industries19. The indicator shows the relative importance of jobs in the tourism industries as a share of the economy''s total jobs.'
