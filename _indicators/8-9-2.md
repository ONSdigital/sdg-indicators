  creates jobs and promotes local culture and products
indicator_definition: >-
  The "tourism industries", or tourism characteristic industries, comprise all
  establishments for which the principal activity is a tourism characteristic
  activity, i.e. the activities that typically produce tourism characteristic
  products (IRTS 2008 paras. 5.10-5.11). For international comparability
  purposes these are (according to ISIC Rev. 4 categories): accommodation for
  visitors (5510, 5520, 5590, 6810 and 6820), food and beverage serving
  activities (5610, 5629 and 5630), railway passenger transport (4911), road
  passenger transport (4922), water passenger transport (5011 and 5021), air
  passenger transport (5110), transport equipment rental (7710), travel agencies
  and other reservation service activities (7911, 7912 and 7990), cultural
  activities (9000, 9102, 9103), and sport and recreational activities (7721,
  9200, 9311, 9319, 9321 and 9329). Regarding jobs, the agreement between an
  employee and the employer defines a job and each self-employed person has a
  job. The number of jobs in the economy thus exceeds the number of persons
  employed to the extent that some employees have more than one job (SNA 2008
  para. 19.30 in IRTS 2008 Compilation Guide para. 7.6). Consequently, the
  number of jobs (demand side) and the number of persons employed (supply side)
  are dissimilar categories and therefore usually do not match. In this respect,
  it should be noted that employment in the tourism industries refers to all the
  jobs (in all occupations) in both tourism-characteristic activities and
  non-tourism-characteristic activities in all establishments in tourism
  industries19. The indicator shows the relative importance of jobs in the
  tourism industries as a share of the economy's total jobs.
