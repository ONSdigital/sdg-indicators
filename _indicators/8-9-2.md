indicator_name: Proportion of jobs in sustainable tourism industries out of total
  tourism jobs
target: By 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that
  creates jobs and promotes local culture and products
indicator_definition: "The \"tourism industries\", or tourism characteristic industries,\
  \ comprise all establishments for which the principal activity is a tourism characteristic\
  \ activity, i.e. the activities that typically produce tourism characteristic products\
  \ (IRTS 2008 paras. 5.10-5.11). For international comparability purposes these are\
  \ (according to ISIC Rev. 4 categories): accommodation for visitors (5510, 5520,\
  \ 5590, 6810 and 6820), food and beverage serving activities (5610, 5629 and 5630),\
  \ railway passenger transport (4911), road passenger transport (4922), water passenger\
  \ transport (5011 and 5021), air passenger transport (5110), transport equipment\
  \ rental (7710), travel agencies and other reservation service activities (7911,\
  \ 7912 and 7990), cultural activities (9000, 9102, 9103), and sport and recreational\
  \ activities (7721, 9200, 9311, 9319, 9321 and 9329). Regarding jobs, the agreement\
  \ between an employee and the employer defines a job and each self-employed person\
  \ has a job. The number of jobs in the economy thus exceeds the number of persons\
  \ employed to the extent that some employees have more than one job (SNA 2008 para.\
  \ 19.30 in IRTS 2008 Compilation Guide para. 7.6). Consequently, the number of jobs\
  \ (demand side) and the number of persons employed (supply side) are dissimilar\
  \ categories and therefore usually do not match. In this respect, it should be noted\
  \ that employment in the tourism industries refers to all the jobs (in all occupations)\
  \ in both tourism-characteristic activities and non-tourism-characteristic activities\
  \ in all establishments in tourism industries19. The indicator shows the relative\
  \ importance of jobs in the tourism industries as a share of the economy's total\
  \ jobs."
