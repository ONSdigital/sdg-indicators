rationale_interpretation: 'This comprehensive convention sets out in one place seafarers'' rights to decent conditions of work on almost every aspect of their working and living conditions including, among others, minimum age, employment agreements, hours of work or rest, payment of wages, paid annual leave, repatriation at the end of contract, onboard medical care, the use of licensed private recruitment and placement services, accommodation, food and catering, health and safety protection and accident prevention and seafarers'' complaint handling. It represents an essential step toward ensuring fair competition and a level-playing field for quality owners of ships flying the flags of ratifying countries. Given that these international legal measures are aimed at improving working and living conditions for seafarers, the most globalized of the world''s workers, the number of countries that have ratified the ILO Maritime Labour Convention gives an indication of the situation of maritime workers around the world.'
