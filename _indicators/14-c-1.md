  through legal, policy and institutional frameworks, ocean-related instruments that
  implement international law, as reflected in the United Nation Convention on the
  Law of the Sea, for the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and their

indicator_definition: This indicator conveys the number of countries that have ratified
  the ILO Maritime Labour Convention of 2006. ILO conventions are legally binding
  international treaties drawn up by the ILO's constituents (governments, employers
  and workers) and setting out basic principles and rights at work. The ILO Maritime
  Labour Convention (MLC) is a single, coherent instrument embodying as far as possible
  all up-to-date standards of existing international maritime labour conventions and
  recommendations, as well as the fundamental principles to be found in other international
  labour conventions.
