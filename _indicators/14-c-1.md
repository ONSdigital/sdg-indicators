  This comprehensive convention sets out in one place seafarers' rights to
  decent conditions of work on almost every aspect of their working and living
  conditions including, among others, minimum age, employment agreements, hours
  of work or rest, payment of wages, paid annual leave, repatriation at the end
  of contract, onboard medical care, the use of licensed private recruitment and
  placement services, accommodation, food and catering, health and safety
  protection and accident prevention and seafarers' complaint handling. It
  represents an essential step toward ensuring fair competition and a
  level-playing field for quality owners of ships flying the flags of ratifying
  countries. Given that these international legal measures are aimed at
  improving working and living conditions for seafarers, the most globalized of
  the world's workers, the number of countries that have ratified the ILO
  Maritime Labour Convention gives an indication of the situation of maritime
  workers around the world.

target: >-
  Enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by
  implementing law as reflected in UNCLOS, which provides the legal framework
  for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources, as
  recalled in paragraph 158 of The Future We Want.
indicator_definition: >-
  This indicator conveys the number of countries that have ratified the ILO
  Maritime Labour Convention of 2006. ILO conventions are legally binding
  international treaties drawn up by the ILO's constituents (governments,
  employers and workers) and setting out basic principles and rights at work.
  The ILO Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) is a single, coherent instrument
  embodying as far as possible all up-to-date standards of existing
  international maritime labour conventions and recommendations, as well as the
  fundamental principles to be found in other international labour conventions.
