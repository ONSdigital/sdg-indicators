indicator_name: 'Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available
  freshwater resources'
target: By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and
  ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity
  and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity.
indicator_definition: 'The ratio between total freshwater withdrawn by all major sectors
  and total renewable freshwater resources, after having taken into account environmental
  water requirements. Main sectors, as defined by ISIC standards, can include for
  example agriculture; forestry and fishing; manufacturing; electricity industry;
  and municipalities. This indicator is also known as water withdrawal intensity.
  The indicator builds on MDG indicator 7.5 and also accounts for environmental water
  requirements.This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the
  country''s renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water stress indicates
  a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation
  to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability
  of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of
  water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors
  represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with
  potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential
  situations of conflicts and competition between users. Total renewable freshwater
  resources (TRWR) are expressed as the sum of internal and external renewable water
  resources. The terms "water resources" and "water withdrawal" are understood here
  as freshwater resources and freshwater withdrawal. Internal renewable water resources
  are defined as the long-term average annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater
  for a given country generated from endogenous precipitation. External renewable
  water resources refer to the flows of water entering the country, taking into consideration
  the quantity of flows reserved to upstream and downstream countries through agreements
  or treaties (and, where available, the reduction of flow due to upstream withdrawal).
  Total freshwater withdrawal (TWW) is the volume of freshwater extracted from its
  source (rivers, lakes, aquifers) for agriculture, industries and municipalities.
  It is estimated at the country level for the following three main sectors: agriculture,
  municipalities (including domestic water withdrawal) and industries. Freshwater
  withdrawal includes primary freshwater (not withdrawn before), secondary freshwater
  (previously withdrawn and returned to rivers and groundwater) and fossil groundwater.
  It does not include non-conventional water, i.e. direct use of treated wastewater,
  direct use of agricultural drainage water and desalinated water. TWW is in general
  calculated as being the sum of total water withdrawal by sector minus direct use
  of wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and use of desalinated
  water. Environmental water requirements (Env.) are established in order to protect
  the basic environmental services of freshwater ecosystems. Methods of computation
  of Env. are extremely variable. For the purpose of the SDG indicator, Env. are expressed
  as a percentage of the available water resources. More details on method of calculation
  of the above variables can be found at http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_res/index.stm
  or http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/wrs/readPdf.html?f=AFG-WRS_eng.pdf.'
