  Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or
  chronic respiratory disease
target: >-
  By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases
  through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.
indicator_definition: >-
  Unconditional probability of dying between the exact ages of 30 and 70 years
  from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory
  diseases.
method_of_computation: >-
  Number of deaths between ages 30 and 70 years due to the four causes / Number
  of years of exposure. Method of measurement Deaths from these four causes will
  be based on the following ICD codes: 100-I99, COO-C97, E10-E14 and J30-J98.
  Method of estimation Modelling, using multiple inputs, is often used if no
  complete and accurate data are available. Age standardization is done for
  comparability over time and between populations.

  Mortality rate due to cardiovascular disease, malignant neoplasms, diabetes

actual_indicator_available_description: >-
  US mortality rate due to combined causes of death related to malignant
  neoplasms, diabetes mellitus, major cardiovascualar diseases and chronic lower
  respiratory diseases.  Crude and age-adjusted rates are both available.
us_method_of_computation: >-
  The crude rate is calculated as the number of deaths due to combined causes as
  identified by ICD-10 codes C00-C97 (malignant neoplasms), E10-E14 (diabetes
  mellitus), I00-I78 (major cardiovascular disease) and J40-J47 (chronic lower
  respiratory diseases) divided by by the UK population.  Rates are age-adjusted
  using the direct method of applying age-specific death rates to the U.S.
  standard population distribution. See
  http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Age-Adjusted Rates for more detail.

  Rates were generated by CDC Wonder using the Underlying Cause of Death
  mortality files. Rates were selected based on the ICD-10 113 Cause of Death
  listing.
