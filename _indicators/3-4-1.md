indicator_name: 'Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease'
target: 'By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.'
indicator_definition: 'Unconditional probability of dying between the exact ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases.'
method_of_computation: 'Number of deaths between ages 30 and 70 years due to the four causes / Number of years of exposure. Method of measurement Deaths from these four causes will be based on the following ICD codes: 100-I99, COO-C97, E10-E14 and J30-J98. Method of estimation Modelling, using multiple inputs, is often used if no complete and accurate data are available. Age standardization is done for comparability over time and between populations.'

actual_indicator_available_description: 'US mortality rate due to combined causes of death related to malignant neoplasms, diabetes mellitus, major cardiovascualar diseases and chronic lower respiratory diseases.  Crude and age-adjusted rates are both available.'
us_method_of_computation: 'The crude rate is calculated as the number of deaths due to combined causes as identified by ICD-10 codes C00-C97 (malignant neoplasms), E10-E14 (diabetes mellitus), I00-I78 (major cardiovascular disease) and J40-J47 (chronic lower respiratory diseases) divided by by the US population.  Rates are age-adjusted using the direct method of applying age-specific death rates to the U.S. standard population distribution. See http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Age-Adjusted Rates for more detail.'
