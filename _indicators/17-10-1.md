  trading system under the World Trade Organization, including through the conclusion
  of negotiations under its Doha Development Agenda
indicator_definition: Worldwide weighted tariff-average is an indicator that provides
  the value of custom duties levied by every importing country from all their trading
  partners. The unit of measurement will be in % terms. All calculations are based
  on official data. However, in order to include all tariffs into the calculation,
  some rates which are not expressed in ad valorem form (e.g., specific duties) are
  converted in ad valorem equivalents (i.e. in per cent of the import value), The
  conversion is made at the tariff line level for each importer by using the unit
  value method. Import unit values are calculated from import values and quantities.
  Only a limited number of non-ad valorem tariff rates (i.e. technical duties) cannot
  be provided with ad valorem equivalents (AVE) and are excluded from the calculation.
  This methodology also allows for cross-country comparisons.
