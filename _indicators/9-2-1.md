title: Manufacturing value added as a proportion of GDP and per capita

target_id: '9.2'
target: >-
  Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries
indicator_name: Manufacturing value added as a proportion of GDP and per capita

indicator_definition: >-
  Manufacturing value added (MVA) is the total value of goods and services net of intermediate consumption. It is generally compiled as the sum of the value added of all manufacturing activity units in operation in the reference period. It can be presented in percentage to gross domestic product (GDP) as well as per capita for any reference year. MVA growth rates are given at constant prices (in Chained Volume Measures [CVM]).

  Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total value of goods produced and services provided in a country during one year. Gross value added (GVA) is the measure of the value of goods and services produced in an area, industry or sector of an economy. In national accounts GVA is output minus intermediate consumption; it is the value generated by any unit engaged in the production of goods and services. The manufacturing sector is defined in accordance with UK standard industrial classification of economic activities. The UK standard industrial classification of economic activities, abbreviated as UK SIC, is a 5-digit classification providing the framework for collecting and presenting a large range of statistical data according to economic activity. The current UK standard industrial classification of economic activities was completed in 2007 and effective from 01/01/2008.
  
computation_calculations: >-
  Percentage of gross domestic product = (Gross Value Added [GVA] by manufacturing sector / Total Gross Value Added [GVA] by all sectors) * 100 OR Per capita = (Gross Value Added [GVA] by manufacturing sector / Population)
