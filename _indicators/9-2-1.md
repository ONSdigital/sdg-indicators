indicator_name: Manufacturing value added as a proportion of GDP and per capita
target: >-
  Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030,
  significantly raise industry's share of employment and gross domestic product,
  in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed
  countries.
indicator_definition: >-
  Manufacturing value added (MVA) is the total value of goods and services net
  of intermediate consumption. It is generally compiled as the sum of the value
  added of all manufacturing activity units in operation in the reference
  period. It can be presented in percentage to gross domestic product (GDP) as
  well as per capita for any reference year. MVA growth rates are given at
  constant prices.

  To calculate manufacturing value added as a percentage of GDP, manufacturing
  value added was divided by the value of GDP and then multiplied by 100.  To
  calculate manufacturing value added per capita, manufacturing value added must
  be multiplied by 1 million and divided by the population.

  Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the value of goods and services
  produced in a given time period. Real GDP takes the value of goods and
  services produced in the UK, but it takes into account changing prices to
  remove the effect of rising prices over time, otherwise known as inflation.
  Per capita shows the GDP per person, GDP per person shows the amount of
  resources available to people in the country.

  Manufacturing value added (MVA) is the total value of goods and services net
  of intermediate consumption.
