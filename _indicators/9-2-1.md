  MVA is a well-recognized and widely used indicator by researchers and policy
  makers to assess the level of industrialization of a country. MVA measures the
  contribution of manufacturing to economy. The indicator is exceptionally good
  for international comparison. Share of MVA in GDP establishes the role of
  manufacturing in the economy. In other words, this indicator specifies the
  contribution of the manufacturing sector to total production. MVA per capita
  is the basic indicator of a country's level of industrialization adjusted for
  the size of the economy. And finally, the MVA growth provides insight into the
  general direction and magnitude of growth for the manufacturing sector. In
  practice, it is a measure of the rate of change that an economy's MVA goes
  through from one year to another at constant prices.

target: >-
  Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030,
  significantly raise industry's share of employment and gross domestic product,
  in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed
  countries.
indicator_definition: >-
  Manufacturing value added (MVA) is the total value of goods and services net
  of intermediate consumption. It is generally compiled as the sum of the value
  added of all manufacturing activity units in operation in the reference
  period. It can be presented in percentage to gross domestic product (GDP) as
  well as per capita for any reference year. MVA growth rates are given at
  constant prices.
