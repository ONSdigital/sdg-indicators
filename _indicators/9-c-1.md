indicator_name: Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, by technology
target: Significantly increase access to information and communications technology
  and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed
  countries by 2020.
indicator_definition: "The indicator percentage of the population covered by a mobile
  network, broken down by technology, refers to the percentage of inhabitants living
  within range of a mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they are
  mobile phone subscribers or users. This is calculated by dividing the number of
  inhabitants within range of a mobile-cellular signal by the total population and
  multiplying by 100. The indicator is based on where the population lives, and not
  where they work or go to school, etc. When there are multiple operators offering
  the service, the maximum population number covered should be reported. Coverage
  should refer to broadband (3G and more) and narrowband (2G) mobile-cellular technologies
  and include: \t2G mobile population coverage: Mobile networks with access to data
  communications (e.g. Internet) at downstream speeds below 256 kbit/s. This includes
  mobile-cellular technologies such as GPRS, CDMA2000 1x and most EDGE implementations.
  The indicator refers to the theoretical ability of subscribers to use non-broadband
  speed mobile data services, rather than the number of active users of such services.
  \t3G and above mobile-population coverage: Refers to the number of mobile-cellular
  subscriptions with access to data communications (e.g. the Internet) at broadband
  downstream speeds (defined here as greater than or equal to 256 kbit/s). The indicator
  refers to the theoretical ability of subscribers to use broadband speed mobile data
  services, rather than the number of active users of such services. This includes
  all high-speed mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions with access to data communications,
  and includes mobile-cellular technologies such as WCDMA (UMTS) and associated technologies
  such as HSPA, CDMA2000 1x EV-DO, mobile WiMAX 802.16e and LTE. It excludes low-speed
  mobilebroadband subscriptions and fixed (wired) Internet subscriptions. As technologies
  evolve and as more and more countries will deploy and commercialize more advanced
  mobilebroadband networks (4G, 5G etc.), the indicator will include further breakdowns.
  ITU collects data for this indicator through an annual questionnaire from national
  telecommunication regulatory authorities or Information and Communication Technology
  (ICT) Ministries, who collect the data from licensed mobile-cellular operators.
  However, they are likely to have different levels and locations of coverage. Another
  method would be to request each operator's coverage maps, which can be overlaid
  with maps showing the population of the country."
