indicator_name: Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for
  public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities
target: By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green
  and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons
  with disabilities.
indicator_definition: 'Public space is publicly owned land and available for public
  use. Public spaces encompass a range of environments including streets, sidewalks
  squares, gardens, parks, conservation areas. Each public space has its own spatial,
  historic, environmental, social and economic features. They can be publically or
  privately managed.  Public Space: Having sufficient public space allows cities and
  regions to function efficiently and equitably. Reduced amounts of public space impact
  negatively on quality of life, social inclusion, infrastructure development, environmental
  sustainable and productivity. It is documented that well designed and maintained
  streets and public spaces result in lower crime and violence. Making space for formal
  and informal economic activities, recovering and maintaining public spaces for a
  diversity of users in a positive way, and making services and opportunities available
  to marginalized residents, enhance social cohesion and economic security. Uncontrolled
  rapid urbanization generally creates settlement patterns with dangerously low proportions
  of public space. As a result, these places are unable to accommodate safe pedestrian
  and vehicular rights of way, land for critical infrastructure like water, sewerage
  and waste collection, recreational spaces, green areas and parks that contribute
  to social cohesion and protected ecological hotspots and corridors. As new cities
  also develop they have reduced allocations of land for public space especially streets.
  On average, at 15% the land allocated to streets in new planned areas is substantially
  less than the standard and in unplanned areas the situation is considerably worse
  with an average of 2%. The generally accepted minimum standard for public space
  in higher density settlements (150 inhabitants or more per/hectare) is 45% (30%
  for streets and sidewalks and 15% for open public space).Total city space refers
  to the built-up area of the city. The proportion of urban areas dedicated to streets
  and public spaces is a crucial feature of the spatial plans of cities. The road
  network is the integrative and dynamic factor between individuals and socioeconomic
  activities. It is a structuring component of geographic space and defines the socio-dynamics
  of an area being conditioned by the spatial pattern, which restricts the location
  of roads and human settlements. Short and direct pedestrian and cycling routes require
  highly connected network of paths and streets around small, permeable blocks. These
  features are primarily important for walking and for transit station accessibility,
  which can be easily discouraged by detours.A prosperous city seeks a tight network
  of paths and streets offering multiple routes to many destinations that also make
  walking and cycling trips varied and enjoyable. In fact, cities that have adequate
  streets, public spaces and greater connectivity are more liveable and productive.
  The use of this indicator aims to integrate urban form and spatial analysis in the
  monitoring of Goal 11 of the Sustainable Development Goals. Spatial indicators are
  vital tools supporting sustainable urban and regional planning. They are valuable
  in the generation of spatial data that is critical for priority setting for harmonious
  and equitable distribution of resources and investments in the territory. This information
  supports decision-making based on evidence and facilitates effective urban management
  and the setting of local monitoring mechanisms to assess impact in localized areas.
  Area of public space as a proportion of total city space, including the land allocated
  to streets. The indicator is calculated integrating to metrics: a) land allocated
  to open public space; b) land allocated to streets.'

We are still looking for a suitable data source for this indicator. Please contact us if you think you can help by emailing <a href="mailto:SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk">SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk</a>.

In the future we plan to split this category so we can show you which indicators represent data gaps are currently in development and which are still left to look at.
