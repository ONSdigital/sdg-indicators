  ICT skills determine the effective use that is made of ICTs. The lack of such
  skills continues to be one of the key barriers keeping people, and in
  particular women, from fully benefitting from the potential of information and
  communication technologies. This indicator will help make the link between ICT
  usage and impact and help measure and track the level of proficiency of ICT
  users.

  Proportion of youth and adults with information and communications technology
  (ICT) skills, by type of skill
target: >-
  By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have
  relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment,
  decent jobs and entrepreneurship.
indicator_definition: "The percentage of youth (aged 15-24 years) and adults (aged 15 years and above) that have undertaken certain computer-related activities in a given time period (e.g. last three months). Computer-related activities to measure ICT skills are as follows: Copying or moving a file or folder \tUsing copy and paste tools to duplicate or move information within a document; Sending e-mails with attached files (e.g. document, picture, video);\tUsing basic arithmetic formulae in a spreadsheet; Connecting and installing new devices (e.g. a modem, camera, printer); Finding, downloading, installing and configuring software \tCreating electronic presentations with presentation software (including text, images, sound, video or charts); Transferring files between a computer and other devices; Writing a computer program using a specialized programming language A computer refers to a desktop computer, a laptop (portable) computer or a tablet (or similar handheld computer). It does not include equipment with some embedded computing abilities, such as smart TV sets, and devices with telephony as their primary function, such as smartphones. Most individuals will have carried out more than one activity and therefore multiple responses are expected. The tasks are broadly ordered from less to more complex."

actual_indicator_available_description: "Problem solving in technology-rich environments (PS-TRE) is an innovative addition to adult literacy and large-scale assessments. In the  PIAAC PS-TRE framework, PS-TRE is defined as: \"using digital technology, communication tools, and networks to acquire and evaluate information, communicate with others, and perform practical tasks.\" PS-TRE measures skills and abilities that are required for solving problems while operating in a technology-rich environment. Specifically, it assesses the cognitive processes of problem solvingâ€”goal setting, planning, selecting, evaluating, organizing, and communicating results. The environment in which PS-TRE assesses these processes is meant to reflect the reality that digital technology has revolutionized access to information and communication capabilities over the past decades. In particular, the Internet has immensely increased instantaneous access to large amounts of information in multiple formats and has expanded capabilities of instant voice, text, visual, and graphic communications across the globe. In order to effectively operate in this environment, it is necessary to have mastery of foundational computer (ICT) skills, including (a) skills associated with manipulating input and output devices (e.g., the mouse, keyboard, and digital displays), (b) awareness of concepts and knowledge of how the environment is structured (e.g., files, folders, scrollbars, hyperlinks, and different types of menus or buttons), and (c) the ability to interact effectively with digital information (e.g., how to use commands such as save, delete, open, close, move, highlight, submit, and send). Such interaction involves familiarity with electronic texts, images, graphics and numerical data, as well as the ability to locate, evaluate, and critically judge the validity, accuracy, and appropriateness of accessed information. These skills constitute the core aspects of the PIAAC PS-TRE assessment. Problem Solving in Technology-Rich Environments items present tasks of varying difficulty to be performed in simulated software applications using commands and functions commonly found in the technology environments of email, web pages, and spreadsheets. These tasks range from purchasing particular goods or services online and finding interactive health information to managing personal information and business finances.

  The first round of data collection in the United States (officially known as
  the U.S. PIAAC Main Study) was conducted from August 2011 through April 2012
  with a nationally representative household sample of 5,000 adults between the
  ages of 16 and 65.
