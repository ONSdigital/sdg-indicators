indicator_name: Proportion of women aged 15-49 years who make their own informed decisions
  regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and reproductive health care
target: Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive
  rights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International
  Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action and
  the outcome documents of their review conferences.
indicator_definition: "From UN-WOMEN:  This is an indicator measuring specific decisions
  by women (aged 15-49) on their own sexuality and reproduction. Interviewees will
  have to provide a 'yes' answer to all three questions in order to count as a woman
  who makes her own sexual and reproductive decisions. The first question looks at
  the ability to say no to sexual intercourse as a critical condition of sexual autonomy.
  The second question measures the woman's decision concerning using or not using
  contraception. The third question measures the woman's decision about reaching sexual
  and reproductive healthcare for her. The three questions are as follows: \t1. Whether
  a woman can say no to her husband/partner if she does not want to have sexual intercourse
  (DHS q. 1054) \t2. Whether using contraception or not using contraception has been
  mainly the woman's decision (DHS phase 7 q. 819 and 820) \t3. Whether a woman can
  make a decision about sexual and reproductive healthcare for herself (DHS q.922
  with added language)  From UNFPA:  The indicator is based on three central elements
  measuring the empowerment of women (married, in union and ever sexually active women)
  aged 15-49 to make the following decisions, : (a) whether they are able to reject
  unwanted sexual relations; (b) using or not using contraception; and (c) whether
  they can access sexual and reproductive health care for herself."
