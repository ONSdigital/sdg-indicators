indicator_name: 'Proportion of women aged 15-49 years who make their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and reproductive health care'
target: 'Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences.'
indicator_definition: "From UN-WOMEN:  This is an indicator measuring specific decisions by women (aged 15-49) on their own sexuality and reproduction. Interviewees will have to provide a 'yes' answer to all three questions in order to count as a woman who makes her own sexual and reproductive decisions. The first question looks at the ability to say no to sexual intercourse as a critical condition of sexual autonomy. The second question measures the woman's decision concerning using or not using contraception. The third question measures the woman's decision about reaching sexual and reproductive healthcare for her. The three questions are as follows: \t1. Whether a woman can say no to her husband/partner if she does not want to have sexual intercourse (DHS q. 1054) \t2. Whether using contraception or not using contraception has been mainly the woman's decision (DHS phase 7 q. 819 and 820) \t3. Whether a woman can make a decision about sexual and reproductive healthcare for herself (DHS q.922 with added language)  From UNFPA:  The indicator is based on three central elements measuring the empowerment of women (married, in union and ever sexually active women) aged 15-49 to make the following decisions, : (a) whether they are able to reject unwanted sexual relations; (b) using or not using contraception; and (c) whether they can access sexual and reproductive health care for herself."

method_of_computation: "From UN-WOMEN: Denominator: Women of reproductive age 15-49 Measurement: Indicator will be measured through DHS and MICS covering most of low and middle income countries. In developed countries the indicator will be measured through national household surveys  From UNFPA  \tThe methodology for this indicator has been developed by UNFPA in close collaboration with UN Women by building on available information from DHS surveys. These three questions are already included in the DHS: (a) DHS q. 1054; (b) DHS Phase 7, q. 819 & 820; (c) DHS q. 922). In all cases these questions are currently asked to women married or in union. Therefore the denominator will need to be expanded to include ever sexually active women. In the case of the last question, the current DHS question just refers to 'healthcare for herself', not specifically SRH care, which will need to be added. \tUNFPA is also compiling and analyzing data from available countries across different regions to understand better how the indicator behaves and whether some additional tweaking will be needed in the formulation of the indicator and its specific components. \tIn DHS, the indicator is already disaggregated by location, economic quintile, and education. For the component related to contraceptive use the indicator is also disaggregated by method of contraception. The proposal is to add age, marital status (married, in union, unmarried) and disability."
