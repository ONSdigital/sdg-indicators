  Conflict-related figures have been compiled from data held by Defence Statistics. The data are presented for Tri-Service and separately for each of the services; Naval Service, Army and Royal Air Force. Figures are presented for UK Regular Armed Forces deaths by Service, Standardised Mortality Ratios1 (SMR) (95% confidence intervals (CI)). UK Regulars are defined as full time Service personnel, including Nursing Services, but excluding FTRS personnel, Gurkhas, Naval activated Reservists, mobilised Reservists, Military Provost Guarding Service (MPGS) and Non Regular Permanent Service (NRPS). Unless otherwise stated, includes trained and untrained personnel. Homicide figures have been compiled from the Homicide Index recorded by the Home Office, which contains detailed record-level information about each homicide recorded by police in England and Wales. The figures are for completed homicides (that is, excluding attempted murder).
