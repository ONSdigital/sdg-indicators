indicator_name: Conflict-related deaths per 100,000 population, by sex, age and cause
target: Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere.
indicator_definition: 'From Goal 16 TST Working Group, OHCHR:Intentional homicide
  is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent of cause
  death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical
  Purposes, 2015). In a narrow sense, conflict-related deaths refer to those deaths
  caused by warring parties directly related to combat, such as traditional battlefield
  fighting and bombardments. In a broader sense, conflict-related deaths also include
  killings that amount to war crimes, such as targeting of civilians or of military
  ''hors combat''. The rates are defined as the total count of intentional homicides
  and conflict-related deaths, respectively, divided by the total resident population,
  expressed per 100,000 population. From United Nations Mine Action Service:  The
  count of conflict-related deaths caused by mines/ERW should include "individuals
  killed or injured in incidents involving devices detonated by the presence, proximity,
  or contact of a person or a vehicle, such as all antipersonnel mines, antivehicle
  mines, abandoned explosive ordnance (AXO), unexploded ordnance (UXO), and victim-activated
  IEDs."'
