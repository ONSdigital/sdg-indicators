rationale_interpretation: "From Goal 16 TST Working Group, OHCHR:\nThese indicators refer to two forms of violent deaths (intentional homicide and conflict-related deaths). Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and have global applicability, while conflict-related deaths occur in countries afflicted by wars. \nThe rates of intentional homicide and conflict-related deaths should be kept separate, as combining them into one single indicator would risk collating two distinct phenomena and unequal sources of data. In particular, the quality of data on conflictrelated deaths is inevitably affected by the difficulties of producing accurate statistics in situations of armed conflict. \nMonitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective prevention measures. It is based on statistical data routinely produced by law enforcement authorities and/or public health institutions, with a high degree of international comparability. \nConflict-related deaths measure the direct impact of conflicts on populations in terms of losses of life. Whilst the global risk of violent death in armed conflict is generally lower than the global risk of homicidal violence, in affected countries armed conflict destroys lives and exerts substantial human costs, particularly in protracted internal conflict situations.\n\n From United Nations Mine Action Service: \n The presence of mines/ERW in conflict and post-conflict contexts is devastating for people and communities. These hazards cause grievous injury and death, impede peace operations, and hamper post-conflict reconstruction and development efforts. \nFindings from the M&E Mechanism for the UN Strategy 2013-2018 (UN M&E Mechanism) illustrate the deadly risk posed by mines/ERW in affected countries and territories in which the UN operates; in particular, the disproportionate impact of explosive hazards on the civilians who constitute more than half of the casualties from mines/ERW. The regular monitoring of mine/ERW casualty data through the global mechanism of the Sustainable Development Goals will significantly enhance the capacity of affected countries and territories including Member States, UN entities, and civil society to understand the scope of these threats and effectively mitigate the harms they cause."

target: 'Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere.'
indicator_definition: 'From Goal 16 TST Working Group, OHCHR:Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent of cause death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, 2015). In a narrow sense, conflict-related deaths refer to those deaths caused by warring parties directly related to combat, such as traditional battlefield fighting and bombardments. In a broader sense, conflict-related deaths also include killings that amount to war crimes, such as targeting of civilians or of military ''hors combat''. The rates are defined as the total count of intentional homicides and conflict-related deaths, respectively, divided by the total resident population, expressed per 100,000 population. From United Nations Mine Action Service:  The count of conflict-related deaths caused by mines/ERW should include "individuals killed or injured in incidents involving devices detonated by the presence, proximity, or contact of a person or a vehicle, such as all antipersonnel mines, antivehicle mines, abandoned explosive ordnance (AXO), unexploded ordnance (UXO), and victim-activated IEDs."'
