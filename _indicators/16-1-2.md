indicator_definition: >-
  From Goal 16 TST Working Group, OHCHR:Intentional homicide is defined as the
  unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent of cause death or
  serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical
  Purposes, 2015). In a narrow sense, conflict-related deaths refer to those
  deaths caused by warring parties directly related to combat, such as
  traditional battlefield fighting and bombardments. In a broader sense,
  conflict-related deaths also include killings that amount to war crimes, such
  as targeting of civilians or of military 'hors combat'. The rates are defined
  as the total count of intentional homicides and conflict-related deaths,
  respectively, divided by the total resident population, expressed per 100,000
  population. From United Nations Mine Action Service:  The count of
  conflict-related deaths caused by mines/ERW should include "individuals killed
  or injured in incidents involving devices detonated by the presence,
  proximity, or contact of a person or a vehicle, such as all antipersonnel
  mines, antivehicle mines, abandoned explosive ordnance (AXO), unexploded
  ordnance (UXO), and victim-activated IEDs."
