Data follows the UN specification for this indicator; however it has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts. As with all indicators, this will be reviewed.

These figures are expressed "rate per million population" to best reflect the UK context.

The Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at <SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk>
