indicator_name: Proportion of countries where the legal framework (including customary
  law) guarantees women's equal rights to land ownership and/or control
target: Undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well
  as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial
  services, inheritance and natural resources, in accordance with national laws.
indicator_definition: "The precise definition of this indicator is: \"The legal framework
  includes special measures to guarantee women's equal rights to landownership and
  control\". The indicator monitors reforms that give women equal rights to economic
  resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land. More specifically,
  the indicator allows for monitoring progress towards gender equity through the adoption
  of women-specific measures to promote women's secure rights to land. The indicator
  has a scoring system from 0 to 4, which signals the stage in the policy/legal framework
  working towards legal reform, as follows: \tScore 0: Absence of the indicator in
  the legal framework \tScore 1: A policy is being developed \tScore 1.5: A policy
  is in place \tScore 2: A draft legislation is to be submitted for deliberations
  \tScore 3: The indicator appears in primary law \tScore 4: The indicator appears
  in multiple legal instruments N/A: Not applicable The indicator considers whether:
  \tNational legal framework gives priority to women heads of household under land
  distribution and titling programmes; \tNational legal framework establishes targeted
  government funds to increase women access to land; \tJoint titling of private property
  (or user rights) is compulsory in the registration process for husband and wife;
  The proposed indicator is supported by a number of international instruments, including:
  \tMaputo Protocol, Article 19(c): \t\"States Parties shall take all appropriate
  measures to [...] promote women's access to and control over productive resources
  such as land and guarantee their right to property\"; \tIt is in line with the Voluntary
  Guidelines for Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests (VGGT).
  Namely: \t\tPrinciple 4 on Gender equality: \"Ensure the equal right of women and
  men to the enjoyment of all human rights, while acknowledging differences between
  women and men and taking specific measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality
  when necessary. States should ensure that women and girls have equal tenure rights
  and access to land, fisheries and forests independent of their civil and marital
  status.\"\t\tSection 25.6: \"Special procedures should, where possible, provide
  the vulnerable, including widows and orphans, with secure access to land, fisheries
  and forests.\""
