  Has the UK established climate change mitigation, adaption and impact
  reduction into its primary, secondary, and tertiary educational curricula?

  Since the United States has a federal education system there is no nationally
  designated curricula for public or private schools.  While schools typically
  do cover some aspects of climate change science, there is a wide range in the
  scope and intensity of these curricula across state and local jurisdictions
  that make curricula decisions. A recent study by the National Center for
  Climate Change Education and Penn State University
  (http://people.oregonstate.edu/~schmita2/Outreach/TeacherWS_2016/plutzer16sci.pdf)
  found that nearly all students were exposed to at least some material on
  climate change during their school years. Three in four science teachers
  allocate at least an hour to discussing recent global warming in their formal
  lesson plans. Most science teachers reported covering the greenhouse effect
  (66%), the carbon cycle (63%), and four or more observable consequences, such
  as sea-level rise, or changes in seasonal patterns, like the flowering of
  plants and animal migrations. About 30% of teachers emphasized that recent
  global warming “is likely due to natural causes,” and 12% did not emphasize
  human causes. Of teachers who teach climate change, 31% reported emphasizing
  both the scientific consensus that recent global warming is due to human
  activity and that many scientists believe recent increases in temperature are
  due to natural causes.
