rationale_interpretation: "Definitions of target elements: \n\tProtect implies a reduction or eradication in loss or degradation \n\tRestore implies a reversal of loss or degradation \n\tMountains, Forests, Wetlands, Rivers, Aquifers and Lakes include ecosystems that provide freshwater-related ecosystem services \n\tWetlands are further defined under the Ramsar Convention as areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres. It may also include subterranean hydrological systems. \nWetlands are a prominent ecosystem type influencing the water cycle and therefore of direct importance to the achievement of Goal 6. Wetlands loss leads to increasing water insecurity and wetlands restoration (increasing wetland area) is now a widespread response to achieving sustainable water. Examples include how wetlands contribute to flood regulation, regulation of surface water flows (flow regulation), and nutrient cycling (pollution regulation/water quality)."

indicator_name: "Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time"
target: "By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes."
indicator_definition: "Percentage of change in water-related ecosystems over time (% change/year). The indicator would track changes over time in the extent of wetlands, forests and drylands, and in the minimum flows of rivers, volumes of freshwater in lakes and dams, and the groundwater table. The Ramsar Convention broad definition of \"wetland\" is used, which includes rivers and lakes, enabling three of the biome types mentioned in the target to be assessed - wetlands, rivers, lakes - plus other wetland types."

method_of_computation: "It is proposed to estimate percentage change in each major ecosystem present in a country, and the indicator will enable Member States to report on those water-related ecosystems that are important to them. Wetland extent is computed through the existing Living Planet Index methodology for data collection and analysis (http://www.livingplanetindex.org/home/index). It consists of a number of stages including harvesting of time series data, codification and database entry, aggregation into sub-indices to reduce sampling bias, and further aggregation to create subglobal (ecologically and regionally specific) and global indices. The methodology is flexible to incorporating improving sources of information and data, for a more comprehensive assessment of trends. The structure of the indicator can be designed to align with the SEEA Water accounts and estimate percentage change in Natural Water Capital available to society based on a) Mean Annual Water Availability; b) Mean Annual Water Withdrawals; c) Environmental Water requirements Aquastat (FAO); GEMS Water for national data (UNEP)."
