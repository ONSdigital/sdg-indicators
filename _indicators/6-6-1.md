indicator_name: Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time
target: By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains,
  forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes.
indicator_definition: Percentage of change in water-related ecosystems over time (%
  change/year). The indicator would track changes over time in the extent of wetlands,
  forests and drylands, and in the minimum flows of rivers, volumes of freshwater
  in lakes and dams, and the groundwater table. The Ramsar Convention broad definition
  of "wetland" is used, which includes rivers and lakes, enabling three of the biome
  types mentioned in the target to be assessed - wetlands, rivers, lakes - plus other
  wetland types.
