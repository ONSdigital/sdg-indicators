indicator_name: Number of deaths, missing persons and persons affected by disaster
  per 100,000 people
target: By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people
  affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global
  gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with
  a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations.
indicator_definition: "Death: The number of people who died during the disaster, or
  directly after, as a direct result of the hazardous event Missing: The number of
  people whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event. It includes people
  who are presumed dead although there is no physical evidence. The data on number
  of deaths and number of missing are mutually exclusive. Affected people: People
  who are affected by a hazardous event. Comment: People can be affected directly
  or indirectly. Affected people may experience short-term or long-term consequences
  to their lives, livelihoods or health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural
  and environmental assets. Directly affected: People who have suffered injury, illness
  or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated; or have suffered
  direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental
  assets. Indirectly affected: People who have suffered consequences, other than or
  in addition to direct effects, over time due to disruption or changes in economy,
  critical infrastructures, basic services, commerce, work or social, health and physiological
  consequences. In this indicator, given the difficulties in assessing the full range
  of all affected (directly and indirectly), UNISDR proposes the use of an indicator
  that would estimate \"directly affected\" as a proxy for the number of affected.
  This indicator, while not perfect, comes from data widely available and could be
  used consistently across countries and over time to measure the achievement of the
  Target B. From the perspective of data availability and measurability, it is proposed
  to build a composite indicator which consists of \"directly affected\", or those
  who are \tInjured or ill, \tEvacuated, \tRelocated and to measure the number who
  suffered direct damage to their livelihoods or assets, \tPeople whose houses were
  damaged or destroyed \tPeople who received food relief aid. Injured or ill: The
  number of people suffering from physical injuries, trauma or cases of disease requiring
  immediate medical assistance as a direct result of a hazardous event. Evacuated:
  The number of people who temporarily moved from where they were (including their
  place of residence, work places, schools and hospitals) to safer locations in order
  to ensure their safety. Relocated: The number of people who moved permanently from
  their homes to new sites due to hazardous event. Note: This definition excludes
  preventive relocation before the event. People whose houses were damaged or destroyed
  due to hazardous events: The estimated number of inhabitants previously living in
  the houses (housing units) damaged or destroyed. All the inhabitants of these houses
  (housing units) are assumed to be affected being in their dwelling or by direct
  consequence of the destruction/damage to their housings (housing units). An average
  number of inhabitants per house (housing unit) in the country can be used to estimate
  the value. Houses destroyed: Houses (housing units) levelled, buried, collapsed,
  washed away or damaged to the extent that they are no longer habitable. Houses damaged:
  Houses (housing units) with minor damage, not structural or architectural, which
  may continue to be habitable, although they may require some repair or cleaning.
  People who received food relief aid: The number of persons who received food /nutrition,
  by government or as humanitarian aid, during or in the aftermath of a hazardous
  event. Hazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon
  in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence of
  a hazard. Hazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity
  that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic
  disruption or environmental degradation. UNISDR recommends setting NO threshold
  for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale
  but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster
  loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are
  combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community. These
  events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries
  but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai
  Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is \"the risk of small-scale and
  large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by
  natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological and biological
  hazards and risks\". Regarding the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards
  in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR
  will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would
  be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member
  States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events including epidemics.
  However, we generally do not expect biological disasters will cause physical damages
  to facilities. ). Note: Terminology will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended
  Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction."
