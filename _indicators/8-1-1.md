  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the monetary value of final goods and services—that is, those that are bought by the final user—produced in an economic territory country in a given period of time (say a quarter or a year). It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. GDP can be measured using the expenditure approach as the sum of expenditure on final consumption plus gross capital formation plus exports less imports, the production approach as the value of output less intermediate consumption plus any taxes less subsidies on products not already included in the value of output, or the income approach as compensation of employees plus gross operating surplus plus gross mixed incomes plus taxes less subsidies on both production and imports.

  The annual growth rate of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is calculated as follows: a) Convert annual real GDP in domestic currency at 2005 prices for a country or area to US dollars at 2005 prices using the 2005 exchange rates; b) Divide the result by the population of the country or area to obtain annual real GDP per capita in constant US dollars at 2005 prices; c) Calculate the annual growth rate of real GDP per capita in year t+ 1 using the following formula: [(G(t+1) – G(t))/G(t)] x 100%, where G(t+1) is real GDP per capita in 2005 US dollars in year t+1 and G(t) is real GDP per capita in 2005 US dollars in year t.
