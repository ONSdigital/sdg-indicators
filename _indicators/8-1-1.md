  No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as
  appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this
  indicator. For insight into the details of potential calculations please refer
  to the original source metadata or source contact. A basic summary of the
  concept  behind the formation of the indicator is as follows:  GDP per person
  can be calculated using the total real GDP and dividing this by the population
  of the country. Annual percentage change can be calculated by subtracting the
  value for GDP per employed person of the previous year from the value for GDP
  per employed person of the current year and then dividing this by the value
  for GDP per employed person for the previous year. Then multiply the result of
  this by 100 to convert it to a percentage.
