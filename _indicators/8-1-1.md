  of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format
  specified by this indicator. For insight into the details of potential calculations
  please refer to the original source metadata or source contact. A basic summary
  of the concept  behind the formation of the indicator is as follows:  GDP per person
  can be calculated using the total real GDP and dividing this by the population of
  the country. Annual percentage change can be calculated by subtracting the value
  for GDP per employed person of the previous year from the value for GDP per employed
  person of the current year and then dividing this by the value for GDP per employed
  person for the previous year. Then multiply the result of this by 100 to convert
  it to a percentage. '
