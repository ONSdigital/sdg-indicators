  Information on unemployment by age illustrates the different dimensions of the
  lack of jobs for people of a given age group. For example, in a country where
  the youth unemployment rate is high and the ratio of the youth unemployment
  rate to the adult unemployment rate is close to one, it may be concluded that
  the problem of unemployment is not specific to youth, but is country-wide. The
  problem of unemployment is unequally distributed when, in addition to a high
  youth unemployment rate, the proportion of youth unemployment in total
  unemployment is high. In this case, employment policies might usefully be
  directed towards easing the entry of young people into the world of work.

  By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women
  and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal
  pay for work of equal value.
indicator_definition: >-
  The unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the total number of unemployed
  (for a country or a specific group of workers) by the corresponding labour
  force, which itself is the sum of the total persons employed and unemployed in
  the group. Persons in unemployment are defined as all those of working age who
  were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a
  specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment
  given a job opportunity.

  The questions noted above were added to the CPS in June 2008 to identify
  persons with a  disability in the civilian noninstitutional population age 16
  and older. The collection of these data is sponsored by the Department of
  Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy. Statistics based on the CPS
  are subject to both sampling and nonsampling error. When a sample, rather than
  the entire population, is surveyed, there is a chance that the sample
  estimates may differ from the true population values they represent. The
  component of this difference that occurs because samples differ by chance is
  known as sampling error, and its variability is measured by the standard error
  of the estimate. There is about a 90-percent chance, or level of confidence,
  that an estimate based on a sample will differ by no more than 1.6 standard
  errors from the true population value because of sampling error. BLS analyses
  are generally conducted at the 90-percent level of confidence.  The CPS data
  also are affected by nonsampling error. Nonsampling error can occur for many
  reasons, including the failure to sample a segment of the population, 
  inability to obtain information for all respondents in the sample, inability
  or unwillingness of respondents to provide correct information, and errors
  made in the collection or processing of the data.  Additional information
  about the reliability of data from the CPS and estimating standard errors is
  available at www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#reliability. CPS estimates are
  controlled to population totals that are available by age, sex, race, and
  Hispanic ethnicity. These controls are developed by the Census Bureau and are
  based on complete population counts obtained in the decennial census. In the
  years between decennial censuses, they incorporate the latest information
  about population change (births, deaths, and net international migration). As
  part of its annual update of population estimates, the Census Bureau
  introduces adjustments to the total population controls. The updated controls
  typically have a negligible impact on unemployment rates and other ratios. The
  estimates of the population of persons with a disability are not controlled to
  independent population totals of persons with a disability because such data
  are not available. Without independent population totals, sample-based
  estimates are more apt to vary from one time period to the next. Information
  about population controls is available at
  www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#pop.

actual_indicator_available_description: "The unemployment rate represents the number of unemployed persons as a percent of the civilian labor force. Unemployed persons are those who had no employment during the reference week, were available for work at that time, and had made specific efforts to find employment sometime during the 4-week period ending with the reference week. Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed. The civilian labor force comprises all persons classified as employed or unemployed. The CPS uses a set of six questions to identify persons with disabilities. In the CPS, persons are classified as having a disability if there is a response of \"\"yes\"\" to any of these questions: 1.\tIs anyone deaf or does anyone have serious difficulty hearing? 2.\tIs anyone blind or does anyone have serious difficulty seeing even when wearing glasses? 3.\tBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does anyone have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions? 4.\tDoes anyone have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs? 5.\tDoes anyone have difficulty dressing or bathing? 6.\tBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does anyone have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor's office or shopping?"
