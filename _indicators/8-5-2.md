indicator_name: Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities
target: By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women
  and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay
  for work of equal value.
indicator_definition: The unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the total number
  of unemployed (for a country or a specific group of workers) by the corresponding
  labour force, which itself is the sum of the total persons employed and unemployed
  in the group. Persons in unemployment are defined as all those of working age who
  were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a specified
  recent period and were currently available to take up employment given a job opportunity.

national_indicator_description: The unemployment rate is a useful measure of the underutilization
  of the labour supply. It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment
  for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available
  for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an indicator of the
  efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the
  performance of the labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate
  can be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator
  often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of
  an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test
  conditions through an active job search.

computation_calculations: 'No calculations were performed in the data acquisition
  of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format
  specified by this indicator. For insight into the details of potential calculations
  please refer to the original source metadata or source contact. A basic summary
  of the concept  behind the formation of the indicator is as follows:  The unemployment
  rate is calculated by dividing total unemployment by the total of economically active
  individuals and multiplying this by 100 to get a percentage.'
computation_numerator: Total unemployment Ã— 100
computation_denominator: 'Total number of economically active individuals '
computation_definitions: |-
  The definition for unemployment is as follows; persons without a job, have been actively seeking work in the past 4 weeks and are available to start work in the next 2 weeks. Or out of work, have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next 2 weeks.
  Economically active individuals are defined as those that are in work plus those that are unemployed.
