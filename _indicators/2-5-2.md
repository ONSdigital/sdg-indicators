  By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed

  The indicator presents the percentage of livestock breeds classified as being at risk, not at risk or of unknown risk of extinctions at a certain moment in time, as well as the trends for those percentages. Risk classes are defined as follows: Extinct: a breed is categorized as extinct when there are no breeding males or breeding females remaining. Nevertheless, genetic material might have been cryo-conserved which would allow recreation of the breed. In reality, extinction may be realized well before the loss of the last animal or genetic material; Critical: a breed is categorized as critical if the total number of breeding females is less than or equal to 100 or the total number of breeding males is less than or equal to five; or the overall population size is less than or equal to 120 and decreasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is below 80 percent, and it is not classified as extinct; Critical-maintained: are those critical populations for which active conservation programmes are in place or populations are maintained by commercial companies or research institutions; Endangered: a breed is categorized as endangered if the total number of breeding females is greater than 100 and less than or equal to 1 000 or the total number of breeding males is less than or equal to 20 and greater than five; or the overall population size is greater than 80 and less than 100 and increasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is above 80 percent; or the overall population size is greater than 1 000 and less than or equal to 1 200 and decreasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is below 80 percent, and it is not assigned to any of above categories; Endangered-maintained: are those endangered populations for which active conservation programmes are in place or populations are maintained by commercial companies or research institutions; Breed at risk: a breed that has been classified as either critical, critical-maintained, endangered, or endangered-maintained.

  Risk category' updated to reflect the following values (count of breeding females): <100 = Critical; 100 - 1000 = Endangered; >1000 = Not-at-risk.
