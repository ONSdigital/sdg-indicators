indicator_name: Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk, not-at-risk
  or at unknown level of risk of extinction
target: By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed
  and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly
  managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international
  levels, and ensure access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising
  from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge,
  as internationally agreed
indicator_definition: "The indicator presents the percentage of livestock breeds classified
  as being at risk, not at risk or of unknown risk of extinctions at a certain moment
  in time, as well as the trends for those percentages. The indicator is based on
  the most up to date data contained in FAO's Global Databank for Animal Genetic Resources
  DAD-IS (http://dad.fao.org/) at the time of calculation. Risk classes are defined
  based population sizes of breeds reported to DAD-IS. The risk class is considered
  to be \"unknown\" if (i) no population sizes are reported or (ii) the most recent
  population size reported refers to a year more than 10- years before the year of
  calculation (10 year cut off point). Links to official definitions/descriptions
  of the indicator are reported below: The indicator is one out of a set of 3 sub-indicators
  which are defined in the document CGRFA/WG-AnGR-7/12/7 \"Targets and indicators
  for animal genetic resources\" (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/026/me514e.pdf)
  and that are endorsed in their current form by Commission on Genetic Resources for
  Food and Agriculture at its the 14th Session (see par 28 CRRFA-14/13/Report at http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf).
  The indicator serves to monitor the implementation of the Global Plan of Action
  for Animal Genetic Resources. In this respect the indicator is presented in the
  \"Status and Trends of Animal Genetic Rescources-2014\" (see http://www.fao.org/3/a-mm278e.pdf).
  This indicator is also proposed for the Target 15.5 under SDG, and it serves also
  as an indicator for the Aichi Target 13 \"Genetic Diversity of Terrestrial Domesticated
  Animals\" under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). It is described on
  the webpage of the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership (BIP), a network of organizations
  which have come together to provide the most up-to date biodiversity information
  possible for tracking progress towards the Aichi Targets (http://www.bipindicators.net/domesticatedanimals).
  Further, it is presented in the Global Biodiversity Outlook 4, page 91 (see http://www.cbd.int/gbo/gbo4/publication/gbo4-en-lr.pdf)
  which is an output of the processes under the CBD. Risk classes are defined as follows:
  \textinct: a breed is categorized as extinct when there are no breeding males or
  breeding females remaining. Nevertheless, genetic material might have been cryo-conserved
  which would allow recreation of the breed. In reality, extinction may be realized
  well before the loss of the last animal or genetic material. \tcritical: a breed
  is categorized as critical if the total number of breeding females is less than
  or equal to 100 or the total number of breeding males is less than or equal to five;
  or the overall population size is less than or equal to 120 and decreasing and the
  percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is below 80 percent,
  and it is not classified as extinct. \tcritical-maintained: are those critical populations
  for which active conservation programmes are in place or populations are maintained
  by commercial companies or research institutions. \tendangered: a breed is categorized
  as endangered if the total number of breeding females is greater than 100 and less
  than or equal to 1 000 or the total number of breeding males is less than or equal
  to 20 and greater than five; or the overall population size is greater than 80 and
  less than 100 and increasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of
  the same breed is above 80 percent; or the overall population size is greater than
  1 000 and less than or equal to 1 200 and decreasing and the percentage of females
  being bred to males of the same breed is below 80 percent, and it is not assigned
  to any of above categories. \tendangered-maintained: are those endangered populations
  for which active conservation programmes are in place or populations are maintained
  by commercial companies or research institutions. \tbreed at risk: a breed that
  has been classified as either critical, critical-maintained, endangered, or endangered-maintained."
