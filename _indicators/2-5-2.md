  By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed
  and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through
  soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional
  and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing
  of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated
  traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed

  Risk category' updated to reflect the following values (count of breeding
  females). =<100: Critical 100 - 1000: Endangered >1000: Not-at-risk  From
  2.5.2 metadata… Risk classes are defined as follows (see also FAO. 2007. The
  State of the World’s Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, edited
  by Barbara Rischkowsky & Dafydd Pilling. Rome. Accessible at
  http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a1250e/a1250e00.htm.): • Extinct: a breed is
  categorized as extinct when there are no breeding males or breeding females
  remaining. Nevertheless, genetic material might have been cryo-conserved which
  would allow recreation of the breed. In reality, extinction may be realized
  well before the loss of the last animal or genetic material. • Critical: a
  breed is categorized as critical if the total number of breeding females is
  less than or equal to 100 or the total number of breeding males is less than
  or equal to five; or the overall population size is less than or equal to 120
  and decreasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same
  breed is below 80 percent, and it is not classified as extinct. •
  Critical-maintained: are those critical populations for which active
  conservation programmes are in place or populations are maintained by
  commercial companies or research institutions. •  Endangered: a breed is
  categorized as endangered if the total number of breeding females is greater
  than 100 and less than or equal to 1 000 or the total number of breeding males
  is less than or equal to 20 and greater than five; or the overall population
  size is greater than 80 and less than 100 and increasing and the percentage of
  females being bred to males of the same breed is above 80 percent; or the
  overall population size is greater than 1 000 and less than or equal to 1 200
  and decreasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same
  breed is below 80 percent, and it is not assigned to any of above categories. 
  • Endangered-maintained: are those endangered populations for which active
  conservation programmes are in place or populations are maintained by
  commercial companies or research institutions.  • Breed at risk: a breed that
  has been classified as either critical, critical-maintained, endangered, or
  endangered-maintained.

**Proxy indicator (Not Expert Led)**

This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator and has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts. We will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification.

The Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at <SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk>
