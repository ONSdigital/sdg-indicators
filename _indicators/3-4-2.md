  Suicide: In the United Kingdom, suicide is defined as deaths given an underlying cause of intentional self-harm or injury/poisoning of undetermined intent. To calculate suicide mortality rates, we took the total number of registered suicides deaths in a year and divided by the population and multiplied by 100,000.
computation_calculations: (Suicide deaths / Population) * 100,000

computation_numerator: Mid-year population estimate for the same calendar year
