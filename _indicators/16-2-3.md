  While it is recognized that this indicator captures only one of the gravest
  forms of violence against children rather than being inclusive of all forms,
  it can be considered a proxy indicator that reflects a key aspect of the
  change we want to observe in order to achieve the target of elimination of
  VAC. 

  The right of children to protection from all forms of violence is enshrined in
  the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols. 'Sexual
  violence' as defined in General Comment No. 13 on the Convention of the Rights
  of the Child, accessible here:

  by dividing the number of young women and men aged 18-24 years who report
  having experienced any sexual violence by age 18 by the total number of young
  women and men aged 18-24 years, respectively, in the population.

  The original figures refer to data that runs from April of that year to March
  the following year. For example, 2015 data date range is from April 2015 to
  March 2016.   Coverage is limited to England and Wales.   The headline data
  are published in July, however the specific breakdowns (disaggregationâ€™s, i.e.
  age, gender, etc) are published in February.   The 2015 to 2016 Crime Survey
  for England and Wales (CSEW) ran for the first time a module of questions
  asking adults whether they were abused as a child. The module on abuse during
  childhood was added to the self completion section of the CSEW in place of the
  follow-up questions on serious sexual assault for survey year ending March
  2016.
