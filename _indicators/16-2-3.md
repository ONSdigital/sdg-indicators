  While it is recognized that this indicator captures only one of the gravest
  forms of violence against children rather than being inclusive of all forms,
  it can be considered a proxy indicator that reflects a key aspect of the
  change we want to observe in order to achieve the target of elimination of
  VAC. 

  The right of children to protection from all forms of violence is enshrined in
  the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols. 'Sexual
  violence' as defined in General Comment No. 13 on the Convention of the Rights
  of the Child, accessible here:
