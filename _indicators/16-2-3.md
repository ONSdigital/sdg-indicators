  the following year. For example, 2015 data date range is from April 2015 to
  March 2016.   Coverage is limited to England and Wales.   The headline data
  are published in July, however the specific breakdowns (disaggregation’s, i.e.
  age, gender, etc) are published in February.   The 2015 to 2016 Crime Survey
  for England and Wales (CSEW) ran for the first time a module of questions

  childhood was added to the self completion section of the CSEW in place of the
  follow-up questions on serious sexual assault for survey year ending March
  2016.
