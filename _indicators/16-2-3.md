  The original figures refer to data that runs from April of that year to March the following year. For example, 2015 data date range is from April 2015 to March 2016.   Coverage is limited to England and Wales.   The headline data are published in July, however the specific breakdowns (disaggregations, i.e. age, gender, etc) are published in February.   The 2015 to 2016 Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) ran for the first time a module of questions asking adults whether they were abused as a child. The module on abuse during childhood was added to the self completion section of the CSEW in place of the follow-up questions on serious sexual assault for survey year ending March 2016.
