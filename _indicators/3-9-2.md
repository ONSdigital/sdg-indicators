title: >-
  Mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All (WASH) services)
target_id: '3.9'
target: >-
  By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination
indicator_name: >-
  Mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All (WASH) services)
indicator_definition: >-
  The mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All (WASH) services) as defined as the number of deaths from unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe WASH services) in a year, divided by the population, and multiplied by 1,000,000.
national_indicator_available: >-
  Deaths attributable to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene focusing on inadequate WASH services, expressed per 1,000,000 population.
national_indicator_description: >-
  The indicator expresses the number of deaths from inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene (with focus on WASH services) which could be prevented by improving those services and practices. It is based on both the WASH service provision in the country, as well as the related health outcomes, and therefore provides important information on the actual disease caused by the risks measured in 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3.

  Definitions sourced from “User Guide to Mortality Statistics” (NOMIS). Base populations: The population estimates used to calculate mortality rates are mid-year estimates of the resident population of England and Wales based on the Census of Population. Our mid-year population estimates are updated figures using the most recent census, allowing for births, deaths, net migration and ageing of the population.  The population estimates used are the most up-to-date when rates are produced. The specific population estimates used to calculate rates are detailed alongside published tables. Sometimes it is necessary to revise mortality rates following population estimate revisions. Any revisions to mortality rates are footnoted on tables. Further information on population estimates, and their methodology is available. Final cause of death: The conditions mentioned on the death certificate are used to derive an underlying cause of death. In some cases, more information on cause of death may become available at a later stage after the death has been registered, such that the underlying cause may be subsequently amended. Around 0.1% of deaths have their underlying cause amended (Table 6). This amended or final cause is used in mortality statistics. Sometimes the later information becomes available only after the annual extract has been taken. Users with access to individual records of deaths as shown in the public record (which is never amended) may consequently find some differences with published statistics.

comments_limitations: >-
  Data rely on (a) statistics on WASH services (6.1, 6.2 and 6.3), which are well assessed in almost all countries, and (b) data on deaths. Data on deaths are also widely available from countries from death registration data or sample registration systems, which are certainly feasible systems. Such data are crucial for improving health and reducing preventable deaths in countries. The main limitation is that not all countries do have such registration systems to date, and data need to be completed with other type of information.
