  Number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex, age and
  key populations
target: >-
  By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected
  tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other
  communicable diseases.
indicator_definition: >-
  Number of new HIV infections per 1000 person_years among the uninfected
  population. The incidence rate is the number of new cases per population at
  risk in a given time period.
method_of_computation: >-
  Number of people who are newly infected in a specific time period x 1000 /
  Total uninfected person_years of exposure Method of measurement Longitudinal
  data on individuals are the best source of data but are rarely available for
  large populations. Special diagnostic tests in surveys or from health
  facilities can be used to obtain data on HIV incidence. HIV incidence can also
  be modelled using the Spectrum software. Method of estimation Modelling is
  currently used to estimate new infections and incidence. Prevalence data
  inform these models.

  (Number of people  who are newly diagnosed with HIV infection (regardless of
  stage of disease at diagnosis) in a specific year and are reported to public
  health authority in state of residence  / Total number of perople in the
  population from which the cases were reported)* 100,000 population.

  Note. Data include persons with a diagnosis of HIV infection regardless of
  stage of disease at diagnosis. Data are presented for diagnoses of HIV
  infection reported to CDC through July 2015. a Estimated numbers resulted from
  statistical adjustment that accounted for reporting delays and missing
  transmission category, but not for incomplete reporting. Rates are per 100,000
  population. Rates are not calculated by transmission category because of the
  lack of denominator data. b Hispanics/Latinos can be of any race. c
  Heterosexual contact with a person known to have, or to be at high risk for,
  HIV infection. d Includes hemophilia, blood transfusion, perinatal exposure,
  and risk factor not reported or not identified. e Includes hemophilia, blood
  transfusion, and risk factor not reported or not identified. f Because column
  totals for estimated numbers were calculated independently of the values for
  the subpopulations, the values in each column may not sum to the column total.
