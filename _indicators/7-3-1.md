  Energy intensity is an indication of how much energy is used to produce one
  unit of economic output. It is a proxy of the efficiency with which an economy
  is able to use energy to produce economic output. A lower ratio indicates that
  less energy is used to produce one unit of output.

target: 'By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.'
indicator_definition: >-
  Primary energy intensity is obtained by dividing total primary energy supply
  over gross domestic product. Total primary energy supply, as defined by the
  IEA, is made up of production plus net imports minus international marine and
  aviation bunkers plus-stock changes. For international comparison purposes,
  GDP is measured in constant terms at purchasing power parity.
