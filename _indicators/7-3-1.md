indicator_name: Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP
target: By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.
indicator_definition: Primary energy intensity is obtained by dividing total primary
  energy supply over gross domestic product. Total primary energy supply, as defined
  by the IEA, is made up of production plus net imports minus international marine
  and aviation bunkers plus-stock changes. For international comparison purposes,
  GDP is measured in constant terms at purchasing power parity.
