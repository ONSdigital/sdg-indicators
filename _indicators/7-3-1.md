title: Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP

target_id: '7.3'
target: By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency

indicator_name: Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP



national_indicator_available: >-
  Reallocated energy use (in Terajoules) divided by gross value added (GVA) chained volume measure (CVM).
national_indicator_description: >-
  Units of direct energy used per unit of GVA (CVM), as an indicator of energy efficiency by sector. The Chained Volume Measures are created from the short term measures of output. The majority of indicators in the short term measures are measuring changes in output as a proxy for changes in GVA. At the reference year (currently 2015) the values are set equal to current price GVA values.

admin_contact_details: SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk
computation_units: Terajoules per GBP (£)
computation_definitions: >-
  Total energy supply, as defined by the International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (IRES), as made up of production plus net imports minus international marine and aviation bunkers plus-stock changes. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the measure of economic output. For international comparison purposes, GDP is measured in constant terms at purchasing power parity.
