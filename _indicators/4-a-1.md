  for pedagogical purposes (c) computers for pedagogical purposes (d) adapted infrastructure
  and materials for students with disabilities (e) basic drinking water (f) single-sex
  basic sanitation facilities (g) basic handwashing facilities (as per the WASH indicator

target: Build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender
  sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning environments
  for all.
indicator_definition: The percentage of schools by level of education (primary, lower
  secondary and upper secondary) with access to the given facility or service. Internet
  for pedagogical purposes is defined as Internet that is available for enhancing
  teaching and learning and is accessible by pupils. Internet for pedagogical purposes
  is defined as a worldwide interconnected computer network, which provides pupils
  access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries
  e-mail, news, entertainment and data files, irrespective of the device used (i.e.
  not assumed to be only via a computer) and thus can also be accessed by mobile telephone,
  tablet, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.). Access can be via a fixed narrowband,
  fixed broadband, or via mobile network. Basic drinking water is defined as a functional
  drinking water source (MDG 'improved' categories) on or near the premises and water
  points accessible to all users during school hours. Basic sanitation facilities
  are defined as functional sanitation facilities (MDG 'improved' categories) separated
  for males and females on or near the premises. Basic handwashing facilities are
  defined as functional handwashing facilities, soap (or ash) and water available
  to all girls and boys. The component on adapted infrastructure and materials is
  yet to be developed.

computation_disaggregation: The indicator can be disaggregated by type of aid (official
  development assistance for scholarships/training in donor country to the total imputed
  student costs for the same period).
comments_limitations: The indicator cannot be broken down by the sector the official
  development assistance is going to or the type of study.   The figures for the indicator
  were obtained by using the “SUMIFS” function to gather figures from the “data underlying
  SID 2016” dataset.
computation_units: 'Thousands of pounds '
computation_calculations: 'The total volume of official development assistance flows
  for scholarships is calculated by adding the total official development assistance
  for scholarships/training in donor country to the total imputed student costs for
  the same period. '
computation_definitions: The volume of official development assistance flows for scholarships
  by sector and type of study is defined as gross disbursements of total official
  development assistance (ODA) from all donors for scholarships.
