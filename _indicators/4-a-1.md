target: >-
  Build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender
  sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning
  environments for all.
indicator_definition: >-
  The percentage of schools by level of education (primary, lower secondary and
  upper secondary) with access to the given facility or service. Internet for
  pedagogical purposes is defined as Internet that is available for enhancing
  teaching and learning and is accessible by pupils. Internet for pedagogical
  purposes is defined as a worldwide interconnected computer network, which
  provides pupils access to a number of communication services including the
  World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files,
  irrespective of the device used (i.e. not assumed to be only via a computer)
  and thus can also be accessed by mobile telephone, tablet, PDA, games machine,
  digital TV etc.). Access can be via a fixed narrowband, fixed broadband, or
  via mobile network. Basic drinking water is defined as a functional drinking
  water source (MDG 'improved' categories) on or near the premises and water
  points accessible to all users during school hours. Basic sanitation
  facilities are defined as functional sanitation facilities (MDG 'improved'
  categories) separated for males and females on or near the premises. Basic
  handwashing facilities are defined as functional handwashing facilities, soap
  (or ash) and water available to all girls and boys. The component on adapted
  infrastructure and materials is yet to be developed.

  Percentage of public schools with Internet access for student use. Estimated
  percentage of public schools with basic drinking water, sanitation facilities,
  and hand washing facilities.
actual_indicator_available_description: >-
  The National Center for Education Statistics has not gathered information on
  student access to computers at school since 1998 (98 percent). We are not
  aware of any data collection NCES has had of the number or percentage of
  schools with basic sanitation facilities. There was a physical accommodations
  survey done in the mid 1970s, but this is no longer at all relevant because it
  was done so long ago and so much progress has been made both with respect to
  school improvement and new regulations. We believe that we do have some
  schools without single-sex bathrooms, primarily because they only have a very
  small number of students or only serve male or only female students.
  Fundamentally, this block of indicators is not policy-relevant for the United
  States. Rather than reporting missing, we are reporting 100 percent which we
  know is close to the U.S. value and reflects the relatively high quality of
  the education infrastructure in the United States.
us_method_of_computation: >-
  NCES is estimating the percentages of public schools having these basic
  facilities at 100 percent. There was a survey in 2008 that found that 98
  percent of public schools had computers for student use. We believe the
  percentage has increased since that date.
comments_and_limitations: >-
  The values are estimated, but we are quite sure that the actual values for all
  of them approach 100 percent.
