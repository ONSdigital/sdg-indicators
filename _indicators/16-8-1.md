rationale_interpretation: "Representation and participation of developing countries in international organizations, including international financial institutions, is often below their relative weight in the world. This indicator would measure the representativeness of developing countries in international organizations. \nAn adjustment could be made to compare the percentage of members or voting rights of developing countries in IFIs to their share in global population (e.g. for governing bodies of UN funds and programmes) or GDP (e.g. for the IMF and World Bank). This would allow compensation for the fact that the indicator should not increase until reaching 100%."

indicator_definition: "Representation and participation of developing countries in international organizations, including international financial institutions, is often below their relative weight in the world. This indicator would measure the representativeness of developing countries in international organizations. This indicator would be easily measurable by way of data collected by international organizations. The indicator would require a list of international organizations that would be included in the calculation. The indicator could be calculated by taking the simple average of the international organizations on the list. The phrase \"global governance\" in the target would suggest that the list of international organizations should be limited to organizations with a global mandate, which could, for example, include the governing bodies of all agencies, funds and programmes of the UN system (including and the IMF and the World Bank), but also the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). This is a global indicator, not a national indicator. National Statistical Offices need not be involved. The rating CBB from the survey is, therefore, odd, especially the C rating because the data on membership and voting rights is readily available, for example, from the IMF and the World Bank. This indicator also relates to: \tTarget 10.6 (which focuses on global international economic and financial institutions). \tTarget 16.3 (rule of law at international level). \tTarget 16.7 (which focuses on inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels)"
