indicator_name: Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in
  international organizations
target: Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions
  of global governance.
indicator_definition: "Representation and participation of developing countries in
  international organizations, including international financial institutions, is
  often below their relative weight in the world. This indicator would measure the
  representativeness of developing countries in international organizations. This
  indicator would be easily measurable by way of data collected by international organizations.
  The indicator would require a list of international organizations that would be
  included in the calculation. The indicator could be calculated by taking the simple
  average of the international organizations on the list. The phrase \"global governance\"
  in the target would suggest that the list of international organizations should
  be limited to organizations with a global mandate, which could, for example, include
  the governing bodies of all agencies, funds and programmes of the UN system (including
  and the IMF and the World Bank), but also the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive
  Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), International Atomic Energy Agency
  (IAEA), Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the World
  Trade Organization (WTO). This is a global indicator, not a national indicator.
  National Statistical Offices need not be involved. The rating CBB from the survey
  is, therefore, odd, especially the C rating because the data on membership and voting
  rights is readily available, for example, from the IMF and the World Bank. This
  indicator also relates to: \tTarget 10.6 (which focuses on global international
  economic and financial institutions). \tTarget 16.3 (rule of law at international
  level). \tTarget 16.7 (which focuses on inclusive, participatory and representative
  decision-making at all levels)"
