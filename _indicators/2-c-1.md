indicator_name: Indicator of food price anomalies
target: Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets
  and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including
  on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility.
indicator_definition: The proposed indicator of food price anomalies measures the
  number of "Price Anomalies" that occur on a given food commodity price series over
  a given period of time.ConceptsThe volatility of a given food commodity price series
  is measured through the quarterly and annual Compound Growth Rates (CGR), of the
  monthly price level. The mean and standard deviation of the observed historic CGR
  values define what is considered to be "normal"volatility for the particular price
  series being considered. A "Price Anomaly" is then defined as the recording, in
  a given month, of a CGR that is greater than the historic mean CGR for that month
  by one standard deviation or more.
