rationale_interpretation: >-
  Economic growth in a country can be ascribed either to increased employment or
  to more production on average by those who are employed. The latter effect can
  be described through statistics on labour productivity and thereby it is a key
  measure of economic and labour market performance.

target: >-
  Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification,
  technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on
  high-value-added and labour-intensive sectors.
indicator_definition: "This indicator is a measure\tof labour productivity growth, which is computed as the annual\tgrowth rate\tof: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at market prices for the aggregate\teconomy\tdivided\t by\ttotal employment. Employment refers\tto the average number of persons with one or more paid jobs during the year."

comments_and_limitations: >-
  Business sector output is based on GDP, but includes only a subset of the
  goods and services included in GDP. The business sector comprises about 75
  percent of GDP since it must exclude those portions of the economy for which
  productivity measures cannot be constructed. General government, the output of
  the employees of nonprofit institutions and private households, and the rental
  value of owner-occupied real estate are excluded.
actual_indicator_available_description: >-
  The measure describes the relationship between real output and the labor time
  involved in its production. Measures of labor productivity growth show the
  changes from period to period in the amount of goods and services produced per
  hour worked. They reflect the joint effects of many influences, including
  changes in technology; capital investment; level of output; utilization of
  capacity, energy, and materials; the organization of production; managerial
  skill; and the characteristics and effort of the work force.
us_method_of_computation: >-
  Labor productivity, or output per hour, is calculated by dividing an index of
  real output by an index of hours worked of all persons, including employees,
  proprietors, and unpaid family workers.

  This indicator is a measure of labour productivity growth. Economic growth in
  a country can be caused by increased employment or more production on average
  by those who are employed. The latter effect can be described through
  statistics on labour productivity and thereby it is a key measure of economic
  and labour market performance.

computation_calculations: >-
  Gross domestic product divided by total employment to give GDP per employed
  person. To obtain annual growth in GDP we subtract the value of GDP per
  employed person of the previous year from the current year and divide this by
  the value of GDP per employed person of the previous year to get the ratio of
  the change. To convert this into a percentage the figure will need to be
  multiplied by 100. 
computation_numerator: >-
  ((Real GDP year n )/(Total employment year n )-(Real GDP year n-1 )/(Total
  employment year n-1))×100
