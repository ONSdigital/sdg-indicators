national_indicator_description: 'This indicator is a measure of labour productivity
  growth. Economic growth in a country can be caused by increased employment or more
  production on average by those who are employed. The latter effect can be described
  through statistics on labour productivity and thereby it is a key measure of economic
  and labour market performance. '

computation_calculations: 'Gross domestic product divided by total employment to give
  GDP per employed person. To obtain annual growth in GDP we subtract the value of
  GDP per employed person of the previous year from the current year and divide this
  by the value of GDP per employed person of the previous year to get the ratio of
  the change. To convert this into a percentage the figure will need to be multiplied
  by 100. '
