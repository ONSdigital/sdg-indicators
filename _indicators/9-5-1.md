indicator_definition: The OECD Frascati Manual provides the relevant definitions for
  research and experimental development, gross domestic expenditure on R&D and researchers.
  Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative work undertaken on
  a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge
  of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new
  applications. (FM '63) Intramural expenditures are all expenditures for R&D performed
  within a statistical unit or sector of the economy during a specific period, whatever
  the source of funds. (FM '358) Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception
  or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems and also
  in the management of the projects concerned. (FM '301) Although an OECD manual,
  the application is global. The Frascati Manual is currently under revision, with
  the next edition to be released in October 2015. The new edition of the Manual will
  be a truly global manual. There will be some changes to the definitions provided
  above, but these are not substantial.
target: Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial
  sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030,
  encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development
  workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending
