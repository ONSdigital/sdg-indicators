indicator_definition: >-
  The OECD Frascati Manual provides the relevant definitions for research and
  experimental development, gross domestic expenditure on R&D and researchers.
  Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative work undertaken
  on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including
  knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge
  to devise new applications. (FM '63) Intramural expenditures are all
  expenditures for R&D performed within a statistical unit or sector of the
  economy during a specific period, whatever the source of funds. (FM '358)
  Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new
  knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems and also in the management
  of the projects concerned. (FM '301) Although an OECD manual, the application
  is global. The Frascati Manual is currently under revision, with the next
  edition to be released in October 2015. The new edition of the Manual will be
  a truly global manual. There will be some changes to the definitions provided
  above, but these are not substantial.
target: >-
  Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of
  industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries,
  including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the
  number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and
  private research and development spending.
