indicator_name: Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement
  for water cooperation
target: By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including
  through transboundary cooperation as appropriate.
indicator_definition: 'Proportion of surface area of transboundary basins that have
  an operational arrangement for transboundary water cooperation. Regular meetings
  of the riparian countries to discuss IWRM and exchange of information are required
  for an arrangement to be defined as "operational".Concepts: Integrated Water Resources
  Management (IWRM) is an approach to managing water in a coordinated way. It takes
  into account the different water sources as well as various users and uses in a
  given situation, with the aim of maximizing positive social, economic and environmental
  benefits. It uses catchments and aquifers, as the principle unit of water management,
  and stresses decentralization of governance structures and active stakeholder participation
  in decision making. Transboundary basins are surface water or groundwater basins
  (aquifers) which cross or are located on boundaries between two or more States.
  An agreement, institutional arrangement and/or an established organization provides
  a framework for cooperation on transboundary water management. Such a framework
  is commonly based on an agreement covering different aspects of transboundary water
  management. Agreements may be interstate, intergovernmental, interministerial or
  interagency. In addition to an agreement (e.g. a treaty, convention, Memorandum
  of Understanding), such framework can be provided by a bilateral or multilateral
  commission or other appropriate institutional arrangements for cooperation. Furthermore,
  multi-sectoral cooperation institutions can cover for water issues. For a cooperation
  framework to be considered as "operational", it requires that there are regular
  meetings of the riparian countries to discuss the integrated management of the water
  resource and to exchange information.'
