rationale_interpretation: "Relevance: With the majority of mankind currently living in cities, and the number poised to increase further by 2030, the success of SDGs will depend largely on how urbanisation is well coordinated and managed. Considering that urbanisation is as a tool for development, many countries8 are now embarking on the development and implementation of national urban policies as tangible instruments to coordinate stakeholders' efforts, harness the benefits of urbanisation while mitigating its externalities. \nThis particular indicator is very relevant for tracking national progress on all other areas in the SDGs and targets where urban and policies are mentioned along with the above 8 qualifiers. This indicator is one of the key metrics to benchmark and monitor urbanisation and asserts the national leadership and political will of national governments. This indicator is based on the notion that the development and implementation of national urban policies should support participation, partnership, cooperation and coordination of actors and facilitate dialogue. \nThis indicator will provide a good barometer on global progress on sustainable national urban policies. It serves as gap analysis to support policy recommendations. The indicator can identify good practices and policies among countries that can promote partnership and cooperation between all stakeholders. \nThis indicator is both process oriented and aspirational and has the potential to support the validation of Goal 11 and other SDGs indicators with an urban component. The indicators has the ability to work at multi jurisdictions level, covering a number of areas while taking care of urban challenges in a more integrated national manner. The indicator has a strong connection to the target, addressing the fundamental spatial and territorial aspect of national urban policy in the context of urban, peri-urban and rural areas. \nSuitability: \nThis indicator epitomises the universality tenet and spirit of the SDGs. It is clearly suitable for all countries and can be disaggregated and/or aggregated by areas of development as explained in the methodology section of this metadata. The indicator will be suitable to assess commitment to address urban challenges and respond to the opportunities that urbanization brings. It clearly responds to Goal 11 harnessing the power of urbanisation for the common good. The indicator is strongly connected to other SDGs goals and targets."

method_of_computation: "Develop a country score card that assesses and tracks progress on the extent to which national urban policy (development and implementation) satisfies the following criteria as qualifiers, based on participation, partnership, coordination and cooperation of actors: \t1) responds to population dynamics \t2) ensures balanced regional and territorial development \t3) prepares for infrastructure and services development \t4) promotes urban land-use efficiency \t5) enhances resilience to climate change \t6) protects public space \t7) develops effective urban governance systems \t8) Increase local fiscal space This indicator places particular emphasis on the aspect of national and regional development planning and the notion of inclusion of sectors and actors, articulated on national urban policies (NUP). The indicator has various key qualifiers that are scored between 0-5 (0-none, and 5 for full compliance). Tools to be used to support the reporting on this indicator include: baseline, benchmarking, point-of-service surveys, scorecard, peer-review and experts opinion, performance monitoring and reporting, focus group discussions, gap and content analysis. With initial support of UN-Habitat and partners tracking and assessment tools and methods will be developed, piloted and rolled out at country level to assess national urban policies developed and implemented based on the qualifiers listed above. Based on expert opinion, the assessment of the qualifiers of the indicator will target national government institutions as well as other key urban stakeholders from academia, private sector, and civil society organization, as per specific criteria of selection of these stakeholders. A threshold will be established to ascertain the level of satisfaction of each qualifier. The method for tracking and analysing progress on national urban policies will collate information on adopted policies, conventions, laws, government programs, and other initiatives that comprise an urban policy. This information would be in most cases already available. The analysis will cover the qualifiers listed above. The standard definition of National Urban Policy5 will be extended and adapted to country context and may include where applicable terms such as National Urban Plan, Frameworks, Strategies, etc. as long as they are aligned with the above qualifiers. For each of the 8 items defined above, policies will be scored on a scale of 1 to 5 for achievement or lack of achievement. Overall aggregate national scores (X) will range from 8 to 40 and these will be standardized to the scale of 0-100 using the following approach. If (X) is the observed aggregate value of the score for the policy performance using the above criterion, then its standardized value X(S) will be computed as; X(s) = 100 ( (X - Min(X) / Max(X) - Min(X) ) Where, Max (X) and Min (X) are the maximum and minimum values observed for X which is 8 and 40, respectively. Countries that achieve maximum values on the scorecard i.e. Max (X) =40, the value assigned via standardization will be 100 while those that achieve minimum score i.e. Min (X) =8 the value assigned via standardization will be 0. Unit: Number/dimensionless Number of countries which have scored above the threshold and are making progress on the range of qualifiers. When analysing the data and the score card, the scorecard of each country could be used to ascertain the overall performance of countries which could then be aggregated by regional groups and specific qualifiers. The scorecard will point to concrete policy recommendations, particularly for qualifiers that need particular attention."
