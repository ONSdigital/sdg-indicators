  Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the population, based on
  the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)
target: >-
  By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor
  and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious
  and sufficient food all year round.
indicator_definition: >-
  These are in reality two related indicators, representing the percentage of
  individuals in the national adult population (15 or more years of age) that
  have experienced moderate or severe levels and severe levels of food
  insecurity respectively, during the previous year.Severity of food insecurity
  is defined as the extent to which people have difficulties in accessing food
  of adequate quality and/or quantity due to lack of money or other resources.
  Difficulties include also psychological concerns associated with the struggle
  in accessing food.

  “Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and
  economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their
  dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (FAO,
  2009). FAO sponsors the Food Insecurity Experience Scale Survey Module
  (FIES-SM) as part of the Gallup World Poll (GWP) and collects information on
  food insecurity in 150 countries. FAO has created a global standard to create
  comparable estimates of moderate and severe food insecurity in countries
  around the world. The GWP obtains a nationally representative sample in each
  country through either phone or in person surveys. FAO’s Voices of the Hungry
  Technical Report: http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4830e.pdf Where it is possible, FAO
  uses Federal surveys already measuring food insecurity to produce food
  insecurity estimates that are comparable in severity to the FIES. For the
  United States, FAO utilizes Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement
  to produce estimates of moderate and severe food insecurity. This is the same
  data used in USDA’s annual household food security report, but threshold for
  food insecurity as defined by FAO global standard is different from USDA’s
  threshold for food insecurity. USDA’s Household Food Security in the United
  States in 2015: http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=79760

  Food security is based on the Rasch measurement model. The FIES as part of the
  GWP has only been administered for two years and only one year of data (2014)
  is publicly available so far. While the FIES is based on well-validated
  experiential food security measures it’s use as an international standard for
  assessing food security is relatively new. Note that the FAO FIES measure
  should be used for international comparisons, but the USDA food security
  measure should be used for more detailed information on U.S. food security.
  The prevalence of moderate and severe food insecurity in the U.S. per the FIES
  standard was 10.2 percent with a margin of error of plus or minus 0.27
  percent. The prevalence of severe food insecurity in the U.S. per the FIES
  standard was 1.2 percent with a margin of error of plus or minus 0.08 percent.
