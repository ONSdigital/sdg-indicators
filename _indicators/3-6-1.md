us_method_of_computation: >-
  Number of deaths attributable to traffic injuries divided by the population
  and expressed per 100,000 population.  Rates are age-adjusted using the direct
  method of applying age-specific death rates to the U.S. standard population
  distribution. See http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Age-Adjusted
