target: 'Support domestic technology development, research and innovation in developing countries, including by ensuring a conducive policy environment for, inter alia, industrial diversification and value addition to commodities.'
indicator_definition: 'Classification of industry by technological intensity is based in R&D intake in manufacturing output. Higher the share of R&D expenditure higher the level of technological intensity. MHT sectors are classified at 3-digit level of ISIC. Above indicator is calculated as the relation of the sum of the value added of MHT to the total value added of manufacturing.'
