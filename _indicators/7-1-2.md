indicator_name: Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and
  technology
target: By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy
  services.
indicator_definition: 'The percentage of population with primary reliance on clean
  fuels and technology at the household level. From non-solid fuels to clean fuels
  Current global data collection focuses on the primary fuel used for cooking, categorized
  as solid or non-solid fuels, where solid fuels are considered polluting and non-modern,
  while non-solid fuels are considered clean. This single measure captures a good
  part of the lack of access to clean cooking fuels, but fails to collect data on
  type of device or technology is used for cooking, and also fails to capture other
  polluting forms of energy use in the home such as those used for lighting and heating.
  New evidence-based normative guidance from the WHO ( i.e. WHO Guidelines for indoor
  air quality guidelines: household fuel combustion), highlights the importance of
  addressing both fuel and the technology for adequately protecting public health.
  These guidelines provide technical recommendations in the form of emissions targets
  for as to what fuels and technology (stove, lamp, and so on) combinations in the
  home are clean. These guidelines also recommend against the use of unprocessed coal
  and discourage the use kerosene (a non-solid but highly polluting fuel) in the home.
  They also recommend that all major household energy end uses (e.g. cooking, space
  heating, lighting) use efficient fuels and technology combinations to ensure health
  benefits. For this reason, the technical recommendations in the WHO guidelines,
  access to modern cooking solution in the home will be defined as "access to clean
  fuels and technologies" rather than "access to non-solid fuels." This shift will
  help ensure that health and other "nexus" benefits are better counted, and thus
  realized. Definition Percent of population with primary reliance on clean* fuels
  and technologies at the household level. *"Clean" is defined by the emission rate
  targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene)
  included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household
  fuel combustion.'
