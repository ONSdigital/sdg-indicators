indicator_name: Average tariffs faced by developing countries, least developed countries
  and small island developing States
target: Realize timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access on
  a lasting basis for all least developed countries, consistent with World Trade Organization
  decisions, including by ensuring that preferential rules of origin applicable to
  imports from least developed countries are transparent and simple, and contribute
  to facilitating market access.
indicator_definition: Similar calculations were already used for the calculation of
  MDG 8.7 (Average tariffs imposed by developed countries on agricultural products
  and textiles and clothing from developing countries). For reference purposes see
  the Millennium Development Goals Report 2015 available at http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/2015_MDG_Report/pdf/MDG%202015%20rev%20(July%201).pdf
