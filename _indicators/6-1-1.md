  Household surveys and censuses currently provide information on types of basic
  drinking water sources listed above, and also indicate if sources are on
  premises. These data sources often have information on the availability of
  water and increasingly on the quality of water at the household level, through
  direct testing of drinking water for faecal or chemical contamination. These
  data will be combined with data on availability and compliance with drinking
  water quality standards (faecal and chemical) from administrative reporting or
  regulatory bodies. The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply
  and Sanitation (JMP) estimates access to basic services for each country,
  separately in urban and rural areas, by fitting a regression line to a series
  of data points from household surveys and censuses. This approach was used to
  report on use of 'improved water' sources for MDG monitoring. The JMP is
  evaluating the use of alternative statistical estimation methods as more data
  become available. The accompanying Statistical Note describes in more detail
  how data on availability and quality from different sources, can be combined
  with data on use of different types of supplies, as recorded in the current
  JMP database to compute the proposed indicator. Predominant type of
  statistics: national estimates adjusted for global comparison.
indicator_definition: >-
  Population using a basic drinking water source ('improved' sources of drinking
  water used for MDG monitoring i.e. piped water into dwelling, yard or plot;
  public taps or standpipes; boreholes or tubewells; protected dug wells;
  protected springs and rainwater) which is located on premises and available
  when needed and free of faecal (and priority chemical) contamination.
target: >-
  By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable
  drinking water for all.

  MDG target 7C called for 'sustainable access' to 'safe drinking water'. At the
  start of the MDG period, there was a complete lack of nationally
  representative data about drinking water safety in developing countries, and
  such data were not collected through household surveys or censuses. The JMP
  developed the indicator use of 'improved' water sources, which was used as a
  proxy for 'safe water', as such sources are likely to be protected against
  faecal contamination, and this metric has been used since 2000 to track
  progress towards the MDG target. International consultations since 2011 have
  established consensus on the need to build on and address the shortcomings of
  this indicator; specifically, to address normative criteria of the human right
  to water including accessibility, availability, and quality. 

  The above consultation concluded that JMP should go beyond the basic level of
  access and address safe management of drinking water services, including
  dimensions of accessibility, availability and quality. The proposed indicator
  of 'safely managed drinking water services' is designed to address this.

  The EPA Office of Ground Water and Dr inking Water (headquarters) calculates
  this measure using data reported in the Safe Drinking Water Information System
  - Federal (SDWIS - FED) and provides the results to EPA regions. This measure
  includes federally - regulated contaminants of the following viola tion types:
  Maximum Contaminant Level, Maximum Residual Disinfection Limit, and Treatment
  Technique violations. It includes any violations from currently open and
  closed community water systems (CWSs) that overlap any part of the most recent
  four quarters.

  EPA classifies Public Water Systems (PWS) into 3 types according to the number
  of people they serve, the source of their water, and whether they serve the
  same customers year-round or on an occasional basis.
