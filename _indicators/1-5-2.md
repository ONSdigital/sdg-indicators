indicator_name: Direct disaster economic loss in relation to global gross domestic
  product (GDP)
target: By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations
  and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and
  other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.
indicator_definition: "From UNISDR: Definition: Direct economic loss: Direct loss
  is nearly equivalent to physical damage. The monetary value of total or partial
  destruction of physical assets existing in the affected area. Examples include loss
  to physical assets such as damaged housings, factories and infrastructure. Direct
  losses usually happen during the event or within the first few hours after the event
  and are often assessed soon after the event to estimate recovery cost and claim
  insurance payments. These are tangible and relatively easy to measure. Direct Economic
  loss in this indicator framework consists of agriculture loss, damage to industrial
  and commercial facilities, damage to housings and critical infrastructures. \tWe
  limit the economic loss into direct economic loss, excluding indirect loss (e.g.
  loss due to interrupted production) and macro-economic loss. The reason is that
  there is not yet universally standardized methodology to measure indirect and macro-economic
  loss while direct loss data monitoring is relatively simpler and more standardized.
  Global gross domestic product: Summation of GDP of Countries. GDP definition according
  to the World Bank. Hazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced
  phenomenon in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence
  of a hazard. Hazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human
  activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and
  economic disruption or environmental degradation. UNISDR recommends setting NO threshold
  for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale
  but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster
  loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are
  combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community. These
  events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries
  but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai
  Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is \"the risk of small-scale and
  large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by
  natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological and biological
  hazards and risks\". Regarding the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards
  in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR
  will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would
  be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member
  States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events including epidemics.
  However, we generally do not expect biological disasters will cause physical damages
  to facilities. ). \tNote: Terminology will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended
  Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction."
