  Occupational safety and health at work are vital components of decent work.
  The frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries and the time
  lost due to occupational injuries provide an indication of the extent to which
  workers are protected from work-related hazards and risks, and present
  information that is essential for planning preventive measures. Possible
  under-reporting of occupational injuries should be kept in mind when
  interpreting the data, and proper systems should be put in place to ensure the
  best reporting and data quality.

  Frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries, by sex and
  migrant status
target: >-
  Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all
  workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in
  precarious employment.
indicator_definition: >-
  An occupational injury refers to any personal injury, disease or death
  resulting from an occupational accident, which is an unexpected and unplanned
  occurrence, including acts of violence, arising out of or in connection with
  work which results in one or more workers incurring a personal injury, disease
  or death. A fatal occupational injury is the result of an occupational
  accident where death occurred within one year from the day of the accident,
  whereas non-fatal occupational injuries entail a loss of working time. The
  frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injury are calculated as
  the number of new cases of fatal and non-fatal occupational injury during the
  reference year respectively, divided by the total number of hours worked by
  the workers in the reference group during the reference year, multiplied by
  1,000,000. The time lost due to occupational injuries refers to the total
  number of calendar days during which those persons temporarily incapacitated
  due to occupational injuries were unable to work, excluding the day of the
  accident, up to a maximum of one year.
