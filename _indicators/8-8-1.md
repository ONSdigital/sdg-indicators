rationale_interpretation: "Occupational safety and health at work are vital components of decent work. The frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries and the time lost due to occupational injuries provide an indication of the extent to which workers are protected from work-related hazards and risks, and present information that is essential for planning preventive measures. Possible under-reporting of occupational injuries should be kept in mind when interpreting the data, and proper systems should be put in place to ensure the best reporting and data quality."

target: "Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment."
indicator_definition: "An occupational injury refers to any personal injury, disease or death resulting from an occupational accident, which is an unexpected and unplanned occurrence, including acts of violence, arising out of or in connection with work which results in one or more workers incurring a personal injury, disease or death. A fatal occupational injury is the result of an occupational accident where death occurred within one year from the day of the accident, whereas non-fatal occupational injuries entail a loss of working time. The frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injury are calculated as the number of new cases of fatal and non-fatal occupational injury during the reference year respectively, divided by the total number of hours worked by the workers in the reference group during the reference year, multiplied by 1,000,000. The time lost due to occupational injuries refers to the total number of calendar days during which those persons temporarily incapacitated due to occupational injuries were unable to work, excluding the day of the accident, up to a maximum of one year."
