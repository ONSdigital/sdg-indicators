computation_units: Rate of fatal injury per 100,000 workers
computation_definitions: >-
  Occupational accident: an unexpected and unplanned occurrence, including acts of violence, arising out of or in connection with work which results in one or more workers incurring a personal injury, disease or death. Occupational accidents are to be considered travel, transport or road traffic accidents in which workers are injured and which arise out of or in the course of work; that is, while engaged in an economic activity, or at work, or carrying out the business of the employer. Occupational injury: any personal injury, disease or death resulting from an occupational accident. An occupational injury is different from an occupational disease, which comes as a result of an exposure over a period of time to risk factors linked to the work activity. Diseases are included only in cases where the disease arose as a direct result of an accident. Workers in the reference group: workers in the reference group refer to the average number of workers in the particular group under consideration and who are covered by the source of the statistics on occupational injuries (for example, those of a specific sex or in a specific economic activity, occupation, region, age group, or any combination of these, or those covered by a particular insurance scheme, accident notification systems, or household or establishment survey). Fatal occupational injury: an occupational injury leading to death within one year of the day of the occupational accident. Case of fatal occupational injury: the case of a worker fatally injured as a result of one occupational accident, and where death occurred within one year of the day of the accident.
computation_calculations: >-
  The fatal occupational injury frequency rate is calculated as the number of new cases of fatal injury during the reference year divided by the total number of hours worked by workers in the reference group during the reference year, multiplied by 1,000,000. The non-fatal occupational injury frequency rate is calculated as the number of new cases of non-fatal injury during the reference year divided by the total number of hours worked by workers in the reference group during the reference year, multiplied by 1,000,000.
