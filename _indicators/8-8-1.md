indicator_name: Frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries, by sex
  and migrant status
target: Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for
  all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those
  in precarious employment.
indicator_definition: An occupational injury refers to any personal injury, disease
  or death resulting from an occupational accident, which is an unexpected and unplanned
  occurrence, including acts of violence, arising out of or in connection with work
  which results in one or more workers incurring a personal injury, disease or death.
  A fatal occupational injury is the result of an occupational accident where death
  occurred within one year from the day of the accident, whereas non-fatal occupational
  injuries entail a loss of working time. The frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal
  occupational injury are calculated as the number of new cases of fatal and non-fatal
  occupational injury during the reference year respectively, divided by the total
  number of hours worked by the workers in the reference group during the reference
  year, multiplied by 1,000,000. The time lost due to occupational injuries refers
  to the total number of calendar days during which those persons temporarily incapacitated
  due to occupational injuries were unable to work, excluding the day of the accident,
  up to a maximum of one year.
