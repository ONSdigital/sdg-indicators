  The probability of a child born in a specific year dying prior to the age of 5
  years is calculated by first calculating the number of deaths of children
  below 5 years of age for a specific year and then dividing this value by the
  number of live births for the same year. Both the numbers of deaths of
  children below 5 years of age, in this case involving the addition of Infant
  deaths (under 1 year of age) and deaths amongst children aged 1-4, and live
  births for a specific year can be drawn from the yearly Childhood Mortality
  statistics, dating back to 2008.
