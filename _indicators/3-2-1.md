title: Under-five mortality rate

target_id: '3.2'
target: >-
  By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births
indicator_name: Under-five mortality rate

indicator_definition: >-
  The probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. The under-five mortality rate as defined here is, strictly speaking, not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time) but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as a rate per 1000 live births.
national_indicator_available: Under-five mortality rate

national_indicator_description: >-
  The average number of expected deaths before the age of 5 per 1,000 live births for a specific year.

  Under-five mortality is the probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births.
computation_calculations: >-
  The probability of a child born in a specific year dying prior to the age of 5 years is calculated by first calculating the number of deaths of children below 5 years of age for a specific year and then dividing this value by the number of live births for the same year. Both the numbers of deaths of children below 5 years of age, in this case involving the addition of Infant deaths (under 1 year of age) and deaths amongst children aged 1-4, and live births for a specific year can be drawn from the yearly Childhood Mortality statistics, dating back to 2008.
computation_numerator: Number of deaths of children below 5 years of age

computation_denominator: Number of live births

computation_disaggregation: >-
  The data can be disaggregated by Sex (Male and Female), Age Categories (Infant [Under 1] and Ages 1-4), and Geography (England and Wales, England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland). This disaggregation can further disaggregated amongst each other (Sex by Age Category by Geography).
