indicator: 3.2.1
method_of_computation: >-
  Number of deaths among children aged 0-4 years (0-59 months of age), broken
  down by age groups / Number of live births Method of measurement The most
  frequently used methods using the above_mentioned data sources are as follows:
  Civil registration: Number of deaths at age 0_5 and population of the same age
  are used to calculate death rates which are then converted into age_specific
  probability of dying.Census and surveys: An indirect method is used based on
  questions to each woman of reproductive age as to how many children she has
  ever given birth to and how many are still alive. The Brass method and model
  life tables are then used to obtain an estimate of under_five and infant
  mortality rates. Census often includes questions on household deaths in the
  last 12 months, which can be used to calculate mortality estimates.Surveys: A
  direct method is used based on birth history - a series of detailed questions
  on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime. Neonatal,
  post_neonatal, infant, child and under_five mortality estimates can be derived
  from full birth history module.Method of estimation The United Nation
  Inter_agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN_IGME) produces trends of
  under_five mortality with a standardized methodology depending on the type and
  quality of source of data available. The UN IGME applies the Bayesian
  B_splines bias_reduction model to empirical data to derive trend estimates of
  under_five mortality for all countries. See the UN IGME link for details. The
  UN GME estimates are not necessarily the same as the official national data.
  Predominant type of statistics: adjusted and estimated.
indicator_definition: >-
  The probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before
  reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age_ specific mortality rates of
  that period, expressed per 1000 live births. The under_five mortality rate as
  defined here is, strictly speaking, not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths
  divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time)
  but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as a rate
  per 1000 live births.
target: >-
  By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age,
  with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as
  12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per
  1,000 live births.

  The data can be disaggregated by Sex (Male and Female), Age Categories (Infant
  [Under 1] and Ages 1-4), and Geography (England and Wales, England, Wales,
  Scotland, and Northern Ireland). This disaggregation can further disaggregated
  amongst each other (Sex by Age Category by Geography).  
comments_limitations: >-
  United Kingdom data is only available from 2008 onward. Prior to 2008 England
  and Wales was the aggregate figure.

computation_calculations: >-
  The probability of a child born in a specific year dying prior to the age of 5
  years is calculated by first calculating the number of deaths of children
  below 5 years of age for a specific year and then dividing this value by the
  number of live births for the same year. Both the numbers of deaths of
  children below 5 years of age, in this case involving the addition of Infant
  deaths (under 1 year of age) and deaths amongst children aged 1-4, and live
  births for a specific year can be drawn from the yearly Childhood Mortality
  statistics, dating back to 2008.
