indicator: 3.2.1
indicator_definition: The probability of a child born in a specific year or period
  dying before reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age_ specific mortality
  rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. The under_five mortality rate
  as defined here is, strictly speaking, not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided
  by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time) but a probability
  of death derived from a life table and expressed as a rate per 1000 live births.
target: By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of
  age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as
  12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000
  live births.

computation_units: Number of deaths per 1,000 persons
computation_calculations: 'The probability of a child born in a specific year dying
  prior to the age of 5 years is calculated by first calculating the number of deaths
  of children below 5 years of age for a specific year and then dividing this value
  by the number of live births for the same year. Both the numbers of deaths of children
  below 5 years of age, in this case involving the addition of Infant deaths (under
  1 year of age) and deaths amongst children aged 1-4, and live births for a specific
  year can be drawn from the yearly Childhood Mortality statistics, dating back to
  2008. '
