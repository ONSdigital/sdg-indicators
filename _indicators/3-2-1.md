computation_calculations: The probability of a child born in a specific year dying
  prior to the age of 5 years is calculated by first calculating the number of deaths
  of children below 5 years of age for a specific year and then dividing this value
  by the number of live births for the same year. Both the numbers of deaths of children
  below 5 years of age, in this case involving the addition of Infant deaths (under
  1 year of age) and deaths amongst children aged 1-4, and live births for a specific
  year can be drawn from the yearly Childhood Mortality statistics, dating back to
  2008.
