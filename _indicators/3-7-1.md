rationale_interpretation: "From Population Division/DESA, United Nations: \nWhile it is difficult to define an ideal level of contraceptive prevalence, since it is dependent, in part, on women's and men fertility preferences, the proportion of demand for family planning satisfied can be interpreted as the degree to which total demand for contraception has been met with an ideal (if improbable) target of 100 per cent demand met. \n\"The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied (met need for contraception) indicator enables assessment of family planning programmes and progress in providing contraceptive services to women who wish to avoid getting pregnant. Access to family planning provides women and their partners opportunities to make decisions about family size and timing of pregnancies. This contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and pregnancies that are too closely spaced, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. Unmet need for family planning shows the gap between women's reproductive intentions and their access to or use of contraceptives. The CPR provides an estimate of contraceptive use in a population. Both the unmet need for family planning and CPR indicators are used for tracking progress towards the MDG 5 target 5B of achieving universal access to reproductive health.\" (WHO, 2011)\n\nFrom UNFPA: \n The contraceptive prevalence rate, which serves as a proxy measure of access to reproductive health services, is useful for tracking progress towards the target of achieving universal access to reproductive health, especially when the indicator is considered in conjunction with information about women's knowledge of family planning or accessibility, and the quality of family planning services. Information on contraceptive prevalence complements the indicator of unmet need for family planning. The sum of contraceptive prevalence and unmet need determines the total demand for contraception. Unlike the unmet need indicator, contraceptive prevalence does not take into account whether women or couples do or do not desire additional children. This makes the indicator more difficult to interpret than unmet need because contraceptive prevalence rates vary across societies with vastly different preferred family sizes. For the same reason, it is difficult to specify the desired target for contraceptive prevalence rates."

target: "By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes."
indicator_definition: "From WHO:\n Percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who are sexually active and who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods.\n\nFrom Population Division/DESA, United Nations: \nPercentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods.\n\nFrom UNFPA: \n The contraceptive prevalence rate is the percentage of women of reproductive age who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one contraceptive method, regardless of the method used. \nConcepts \nWomen of reproductive age include all women of reproductive age (15-49) who are married or in consensual union. \nContraceptive methods include modern and traditional methods. Modern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, oral hormonal pills, intra-uterine devices (IUD), male condoms, injectables, implants (including Norplant), vaginal barrier methods, female condoms, and emergency contraception. Traditional methods of contraception include the rhythm method (periodic abstinence), withdrawal, lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) and folk methods."

method_of_computation: "Number of women with family planning demand who use modern methods / Total number of women in need of family planning \nMethod of measurement \nHousehold surveys include a series of questions to measure modern contraceptive prevalence rate and demand for family planning.\nTotal demand for family planning is defined as the sum of the number of women of reproductive age (15'49 years) who are married or in a union and who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one contraceptive method, and the unmet need for family planning. Unmet need for family planning is the proportion of women of reproductive age (15'49 years) either married or in a consensual union, who are fecund and sexually active but who are not using any method of contraception (modern or traditional), and report not wanting any more children or wanting to delay the birth of their next child for at least two years. Included are: (i) all pregnant women (married or in a consensual union) whose pregnancies were unwanted or mistimed at the time of conception; (ii) all postpartum amenorrhoeic women (married or in consensual union) who are not using family planning and whose last birth was unwanted or mistimed; (iii) all fecund women (married or in consensual union) who are neither pregnant nor postpartum amenorrhoeic, and who either do not want any more children (want to limit family size), or who wish to postpone the birth of a child for at least two years or do not know when or if they want another child (want to space births), but are not using any contraceptive method.\n\nFrom Population Division/DESA, United Nations: \nThe numerator is the percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years old) who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one modern contraceptive method. The denominator is the total demand for family planning (the sum of contraceptive prevalence (any method) and the unmet need for family planning. \nMetadata on the definition, method of computation and other information for each component' contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family planning'are included in the MDG database as each was an indicator (5.3 and 5.6) used for global monitoring of MDG target 5.B. Achieve, by 2015, universal access to reproductive health. An important limitation, though, of the indicators used in MDG monitoring is that they were only with reference to women of reproductive age who are married or in a union. The indicators missed women who are not married but who are exposed to the risk of pregnancy. \nSee http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx \nThe proposed indicator limits the numerator to women who are using a modern method of family planning. Women who are using a traditional method of contraception are not considered as having a met need for family planning. \nIn contrast, the indicator 'Demand for family planning satisfied (met need for contraception)' (regardless if the method used is modern or traditional).is a key indicator under the Every Woman, Every Child initiative and is described in detail in the handbook 'Monitoring maternal, newborn and child health: understanding key progress indicators' available here from WHO (2011): http://www.who.int/entity/healthmetrics/news/monitoring_maternal_newborn_child_health.pdf.\n\nFrom UNFPA: \n ( Women using a contraceptive method / Women of reproductive age ) X 100"
