  Number of women with family planning demand who use modern methods / Total
  number of women in need of family planning Method of measurement Household
  surveys include a series of questions to measure modern contraceptive
  prevalence rate and demand for family planning.Total demand for family
  planning is defined as the sum of the number of women of reproductive age
  (15'49 years) who are married or in a union and who are currently using, or
  whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one contraceptive method,
  and the unmet need for family planning. Unmet need for family planning is the
  proportion of women of reproductive age (15'49 years) either married or in a
  consensual union, who are fecund and sexually active but who are not using any
  method of contraception (modern or traditional), and report not wanting any
  more children or wanting to delay the birth of their next child for at least
  two years. Included are: (i) all pregnant women (married or in a consensual
  union) whose pregnancies were unwanted or mistimed at the time of conception;
  (ii) all postpartum amenorrhoeic women (married or in consensual union) who
  are not using family planning and whose last birth was unwanted or mistimed;
  (iii) all fecund women (married or in consensual union) who are neither
  pregnant nor postpartum amenorrhoeic, and who either do not want any more
  children (want to limit family size), or who wish to postpone the birth of a
  child for at least two years or do not know when or if they want another child
  (want to space births), but are not using any contraceptive method.From
  Population Division/DESA, United Nations: The numerator is the percentage of
  women of reproductive age (15-49 years old) who are currently using, or whose
  sexual partner is currently using, at least one modern contraceptive method.
  The denominator is the total demand for family planning (the sum of
  contraceptive prevalence (any method) and the unmet need for family planning.
  Metadata on the definition, method of computation and other information for
  each component' contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family
  planning'are included in the MDG database as each was an indicator (5.3 and
  5.6) used for global monitoring of MDG target 5.B. Achieve, by 2015, universal
  access to reproductive health. An important limitation, though, of the
  indicators used in MDG monitoring is that they were only with reference to
  women of reproductive age who are married or in a union. The indicators missed
  women who are not married but who are exposed to the risk of pregnancy. See
  http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx The proposed indicator limits the
  numerator to women who are using a modern method of family planning. Women who
  are using a traditional method of contraception are not considered as having a
  met need for family planning. In contrast, the indicator 'Demand for family
  planning satisfied (met need for contraception)' (regardless if the method
  used is modern or traditional).is a key indicator under the Every Woman, Every
  Child initiative and is described in detail in the handbook 'Monitoring
  maternal, newborn and child health: understanding key progress indicators'

  contraceptive method, regardless of the method used. Concepts Women of
  reproductive age include all women of reproductive age (15-49) who are married
  or in consensual union. Contraceptive methods include modern and traditional
  methods. Modern methods of contraception include female and male
  sterilization, oral hormonal pills, intra-uterine devices (IUD), male condoms,
  injectables, implants (including Norplant), vaginal barrier methods, female
  condoms, and emergency contraception. Traditional methods of contraception
  include the rhythm method (periodic abstinence), withdrawal, lactational
  amenorrhea method (LAM) and folk methods.

  From Population Division/DESA, United Nations: 

  While it is difficult to define an ideal level of contraceptive prevalence,
  since it is dependent, in part, on women's and men fertility preferences, the
  proportion of demand for family planning satisfied can be interpreted as the
  degree to which total demand for contraception has been met with an ideal (if
  improbable) target of 100 per cent demand met. 

  "The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied (met need for
  contraception) indicator enables assessment of family planning programmes and
  progress in providing contraceptive services to women who wish to avoid
  getting pregnant. Access to family planning provides women and their partners
  opportunities to make decisions about family size and timing of pregnancies.
  This contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended
  pregnancies and pregnancies that are too closely spaced, which are at higher
  risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. Unmet need for family planning shows the
  gap between women's reproductive intentions and their access to or use of
  contraceptives. The CPR provides an estimate of contraceptive use in a
  population. Both the unmet need for family planning and CPR indicators are
  used for tracking progress towards the MDG 5 target 5B of achieving universal
  access to reproductive health." (WHO, 2011)


  From UNFPA: 
   The contraceptive prevalence rate, which serves as a proxy measure of access to reproductive health services, is useful for tracking progress towards the target of achieving universal access to reproductive health, especially when the indicator is considered in conjunction with information about women's knowledge of family planning or accessibility, and the quality of family planning services. Information on contraceptive prevalence complements the indicator of unmet need for family planning. The sum of contraceptive prevalence and unmet need determines the total demand for contraception. Unlike the unmet need indicator, contraceptive prevalence does not take into account whether women or couples do or do not desire additional children. This makes the indicator more difficult to interpret than unmet need because contraceptive prevalence rates vary across societies with vastly different preferred family sizes. For the same reason, it is difficult to specify the desired target for contraceptive prevalence rates.
