  There are many programs throughout the United States that build capacity to
  implement adaptation, mitigation and technology transfer, and development
  actions, including at the federal level. For example, the Resilience
  Americorps program which recruits, trains, and embeds Americorps members in
  ten communities across the country to increase civic engagement and community
  resilience in low-income areas, and help those communities develop plans for
  becoming more resilient to any number of shocks and stresses, including better
  preparations for extreme weather events.  For more information:
