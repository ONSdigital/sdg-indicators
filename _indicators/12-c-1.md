  Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption)
  and as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels
target: >-
  Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful
  consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national
  circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those
  harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts,
  taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing
  countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in
  a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities
