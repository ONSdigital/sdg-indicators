indicator_name: Number of victims of human trafficking per 100,000 population, by
  sex, age and form of exploitation
target: End abuse, exploitations, trafficking and all forms of violence against and
  torture of children.
indicator_definition: 'From UNODC and OHCHR:  Trafficking in persons is defined as
  the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by
  means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of
  fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or
  of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person
  having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation
  shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other
  forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar
  to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs (The United Nations Protocol to Prevent
  Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, which
  is supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime).
  The number of victims is defined as the number of detected and estimated number
  of non-detected adult women and men and girls and boys (18-) who have been trafficked
  for different forms of trafficking in persons. The estimated ratio between the number
  of detected victims and the estimated number of non-detected victims can be used
  to estimate the total number of human trafficking victims at national, regional
  and global levels. In addition, the ratio can be used to measure the efficiency
  of countries to detect trafficking victims.  From Goal 16 TST Working Group:  This
  is an outcome indicator derived from administrative data. The indicator is computed
  as the total number of identified victims of trafficking divided by population (per
  100,000 persons). This indicator directly measures exploitation and trafficking,
  which are inadequately captured by the other proposed indicators. These human rights
  abuses affect both adults and children, and States have existing obligations to
  prevent them for both population groups.'
