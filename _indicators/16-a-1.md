  with the Paris Principles
target: Strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international
  cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries,
  to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime
indicator_definition: "Definition This indicator measures the proportion of countries\
  \ that have internationally recognized independent (NHRIs) based on the rules of\
  \ procedure of the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions\
  \ (ICC). Concepts A National Human Rights Institution is an independent administrative\
  \ body set up by a State to promote and protect human rights. NHRIs are State bodies\
  \ with a constitutional and/or legislative mandate to protect and promote human\
  \ rights. They are part of the State apparatus and are funded by the State. However,\
  \ they operate and function independently from government. While their specific\
  \ mandate may vary, the general role of NHRIs is to address discrimination in all\
  \ its forms, as well as to promote the protection of civil, political, economic,\
  \ social and cultural rights. Core functions of NHRIs include complaint handling,\
  \ human rights education and making recommendations on law reform. Effective NHRIs\
  \ are an important link between government and civil society, in so far as they\
  \ help bridge the 'protection gap' between the rights of individuals and the responsibilities\
  \ of the State. Six models of NHRIs exist across all regions of the world today,\
  \ namely: Human rights commissions, Human rights ombudsman institutions, Hybrid\
  \ institutions, Consultative and advisory bodies, Institutes and centres and multiple\
  \ institutions. An Independent NHRI is an institution with 'A level' accreditation\
  \ status as benchmarked against the United Nations Paris Principles, which were\
  \ adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1993.1 The process of accreditation\
  \ is conducted through peer review by the Sub-Committee on Accreditation (SCA) of\
  \ the ICC. There are three possible types of accreditation: A: Compliance with Paris\
  \ Principles B: Observer Status ' Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles\
  \ or insufficient information provided to make a determination C: Non-compliant\
  \ with the Paris Principles Accreditation by the ICC entails a determination whether\
  \ the NHRI is compliant, both in law and practice, with the Paris principles, the\
  \ principal source of the normative standards for NHRIs, as well as with the General\
  \ Observations developed by the SCA. Other international standards may also be taken\
  \ into account by the SCA, including the provisions related to the establishment\
  \ of national mechanisms in the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture\
  \ and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as well as in the\
  \ International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Likewise,\
  \ the SCA looks at any NHRI-related recommendation from the international human\
  \ rights mechanisms, notably, the Treaty Bodies, Universal Periodic Review (UPR)\
  \ and special procedures. The process also looks into the effectiveness and level\
  \ of engagement with international human rights systems. Method of computation The\
  \ indicator is computed as the accreditation classification, namely A, B or C of\
  \ the NHRI."
