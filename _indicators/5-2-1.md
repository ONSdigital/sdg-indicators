comments_limitations: Presently the only ages covered are between 16 and 59 but the
  upper bound of this is likely to increase over time. The original figures refer
  to data that runs from April of that year to March the following year. For example
  2015 data date range is from April 2015 to March 2016.  These data relate to women
  aged 16 and over (as opposed to 15 and over)  The headline data are published in
  July, however the specific breakdowns (disaggregation’s, i.e. age,  etc) are published
  in February.  Coverage is limited to England and Wales.
computation_calculations: 'No calculations were performed in the data acquisition
  of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format
  specified by this indicator. For insight into the details of potential calculations
  please refer to the original source metadata or source contact. A basic summary
  of the concept  behind the formation of the indicator is as follows:  Taking the
  total number of women aged 16 to 59 in England and Wales who experienced any abuse
  by a partner or ex-partner in the past 12 months and divided this by the total number
  of women with the same age category in England/Wales and multiplied by 100. '
computation_numerator: Number of women aged 16-59 in England and Wales who experienced
  any abuse by a partner or ex-partner in the previous twelve months
computation_denominator: Number of women aged 16-59 in England and Wales
computation_definitions: 'Partner abuse - non-sexual: physical force, emotional or
  financial abuse or threats to hurt the respondent or someone close to them carried
  out by a current or former partner Sexual assault: rape or assault by penetration
  including attempts (‘serious’), indecent exposure or unwanted touching (‘less serious’)
  carried out by any person Stalking: 2 or more incidents (causing distress, fear
  or alarm) of receiving obscene or threatening unwanted letters, emails, text messages
