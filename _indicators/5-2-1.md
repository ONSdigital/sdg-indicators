  This table contains estimated volume numbers based on both the FBI UCR
  Program's legacy and revised definitions of rape.  The data do not include
  other forms of violence other than rape.  The data include all rapes reported
  to the FBI UCR Program and are not limited to intimate partner. In 2013, the
  FBI UCR Program initiated the collection of rape data under a revised
  definition and removed the term “forcible” from the offense name. Column
  heading Year - is the year the data represents. Column Heading Revised Rape
  Definitions are the estimates of data collected under the revised rape
  definition: Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any
  body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person,
  without the consent of the victim. (This includes the offenses of rape,
  sodomy, and sexual assault with an object as converted from data submitted via
  the National Incident-Based Reporting System [NIBRS].) Column Heading Legacy
  Rape Definition are the estimates of data collected under the legacy rape
  definition: The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will
  Indicator data on sexual assault is available in the National Incident-Based
  Reporting System (NIBRS); however,  NIBRS currently represents less than 30%
  of the nation's population and nonresponse cannot be modeled to adjust for
  bias because statistical sampling methodologies were not used.
us_method_of_computation: >-
  Agencies submit data based on only one of these definitions. Within each
  population group size, the proportion of female rape victims was calculated
  from all NIBRS reports of rape, sodomy, and sexual assault with an object. For
  agencies that reported using the revised definition, the actual number of
  reported rapes was decreased by the calculated proportion to arrive at an
  estimate for the number of rapes using the legacy definition. Conversely, for
  agencies that reported using the legacy definition, the actual number of
  reported rapes was increased by the inverse of the proportion to arrive at an
  estimate for the number of rapes using the revised definition.
comments_and_limitations: >-
  The data do not include other forms of violence other than rape.  The data
  include all rapes reported to the FBI UCR Program and are not limited to
  intimate partner. In 2013, the Summary UCR definition of rape was changed to
  “penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part
  or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the
  consent of the victim.” The new definition updated the 80-year-old historical
  definition of rape which was “carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and
  against her will.” Effectively, the revised definition expands rape to include
  both male and female victims and offenders, and reflects the various forms of
  sexual penetration understood to be rape, especially nonconsenting acts of
  sodomy, and sexual assaults with objects.

comments_limitations: >-
  Presently the only ages covered are between 16 and 59 but the upper bound of
  this is likely to increase over time. The original figures refer to data that
  runs from April of that year to March the following year. For example 2015
  data date range is from April 2015 to March 2016.  These data relate to women
  aged 16 and over (as opposed to 15 and over)  The headline data are published
  in July, however the specific breakdowns (disaggregation’s, i.e. age,  etc)
  are published in February.  Coverage is limited to England and Wales.
computation_calculations: >-
  No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as
  appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this
  indicator. For insight into the details of potential calculations please refer
  to the original source metadata or source contact. A basic summary of the
  concept  behind the formation of the indicator is as follows:  Taking the
  total number of women aged 16 to 59 in England and Wales who experienced any
  abuse by a partner or ex-partner in the past 12 months and divided this by the
  total number of women with the same age category in England/Wales and
  multiplied by 100.
