  Intimate partner violence includes any abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner within the context of marriage, cohabitation or any other formal or informal union. The different forms of violence included in the indicator are defined as follows: i) Physical violence consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim and include, but are not limited to, pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm, pulling the hair, slapping, kicking, biting or hitting with the fist or object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose, or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife; ii) Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, incest, sexual harassment, etc. In intimate partner relationships, experiencing sexual violence is commonly defined as being forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner might do, and/or being forced to so something sexual that the woman considers humiliating or degrading; iii) Psychological violence includes a range of behaviours that encompass acts of emotional abuse and controlling behaviour. These often coexist with acts of physical and sexual violence by intimate partners and are acts of violence in themselves. For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual and psychological violence against women see Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys (UN, 2014). According to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993), Violence against Women is “Any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family […]”.

computation_calculations: >-
  No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator. For insight into the details of potential calculations please refer to the original source metadata or source contact. A basic summary of the concept  behind the formation of the indicator is as follows:  Taking the total number of women aged 16 to 59 in England and Wales who experienced any abuse by a partner or ex-partner in the past 12 months and divided this by the total number of women with the same age category in England/Wales and multiplied by 100.

comments_limitations: >-
  Presently the only ages covered are between 16 and 59 but the upper bound of this is likely to increase over time. The original figures refer to data that runs from April of that year to March the following year. For example 2015 data date range is from April 2015 to March 2016. These data relate to women aged 16 and over (as opposed to 15 and over)
   The headline data are published in July, however the specific breakdowns (disaggregation’s, i.e. age, etc) are published in February. Coverage is limited to England and Wales.
