  Passenger and freight volumes is the sum of the passenger and freight volumes reported for the air carriers in terms of number of people and metric tonnes of cargo respectively. The International Transport Forum (ITF) collects data on transport (rail and road) statistics on annual basis from all its Member countries. Data are collected from Transport Ministries, statistical offices and other institution designated as official data source. Although there are clear definitions for all the terms used in this survey, countries might have different methodologies to calculate tonne-kilometres and passenger-kilometres. Methods could be based on traffic or mobility surveys, use very different sampling methods and estimating techniques which could affect the comparability of their statistics. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through its Statistics Division have established standard methodologies and definitions to collect and report traffic (passenger and freight volume) data related to air transport. These standards and methodologies have been adopted by the 191 Member States of ICAO and also by the Industry stakeholders i,e air carriers and airports. The data of ICAO is used by States and also the World Bank for its development indicators. ICAO uses Air Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and freight volumes for air transport. Precise definition of all different concepts and metadata related to Air Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and freight volumes for air transport. Approved by the ICAO Statistics Division and Member States can be found at the ICAO website given below - http://www.icao.int/sustainability/pages/eap-sta-excel.aspx/.

  The indicator is calculated through a sum of the passenger and freight volumes reported for the air carriers through ICAO Air Transport Reporting Forms and grouped by Member States of ICAO.

This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator and has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts. We will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification.
  
The Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at <SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk>
