indicator_name: Passenger and freight volumes, by mode of transport
target: Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including
  regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human
  well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all.
indicator_definition: 'Average parcel shipping time/parcel shipping time standards,
  by country, both for domestic and international parcel services, and by product:
  this is the level of reliability of domestic or international parcel delivery services
  and for different products exchanged between countries. This ratio is determined
  after dividing the average parcel shipping time by the standard shipping time expected
  for parcels delivery at the national or international level, and at the product
  level depending on data availability. An alternative way of computing a similar
  quality of service ratio would be to use the percentage of parcels actually delivered
  within the quality standard, i.e. within the standard for shipping times. The standard
  for shipping time is the expected end-to-end transit time and is often expressed
  as the posting day + one, two , three, four or five days depending on the country
  geography and distance between countries.'
