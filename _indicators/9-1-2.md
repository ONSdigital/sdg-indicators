rationale_interpretation: "With the strong development of national and international e-commerce, the quality of the postal and parcels delivery services is becoming a major concern for millions of enterprises and consumers transacting online. It is sometimes considered as a major hurdle by these market players and one of the challenges for trade facilitation, particularly for micro, small and medium-size enterprises interested in internationalizing their activities."

indicator_name: "Passenger and freight volumes, by mode of transport"
target: "Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all."
indicator_definition: "Average parcel shipping time/parcel shipping time standards, by country, both for domestic and international parcel services, and by product: this is the level of reliability of domestic or international parcel delivery services and for different products exchanged between countries. This ratio is determined after dividing the average parcel shipping time by the standard shipping time expected for parcels delivery at the national or international level, and at the product level depending on data availability. An alternative way of computing a similar quality of service ratio would be to use the percentage of parcels actually delivered within the quality standard, i.e. within the standard for shipping times. The standard for shipping time is the expected end-to-end transit time and is often expressed as the posting day + one, two , three, four or five days depending on the country geography and distance between countries."
