  Mobile phone networks have spread rapidly over the last decade and the number
  of mobile-cellular subscriptions is quasi equal to the number of the people
  living on earth. However, not every person uses, or owns a mobile-cellular
  telephone. Mobile phone ownership, in particular, is important to track gender
  equality since the mobile phone is a personal device that, if owned and not
  just shared, provides women with a degree of independence and autonomy,
  including for professional purposes. A number of studies have highlighted the
  link between mobile phone ownership and empowerment, and productivity growth. 

  Existing data on the proportion of women owning a mobile phone suggest that
  less women than men own a mobile phone. This indicator highlights the
  importance of mobile phone ownership to track and to improve gender equality,
  and monitoring will help design targeted policies to overcome the gender
  divide. The collection of this indicator was proposed by the Task Group on
  Gender of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development.

indicator_definition: >-
  This indicator is defined as the 'proportion of individuals who own a mobile
  telephone, by sex'. An individual owns a mobile cellular phone if he/she has a
  mobile cellular phone device with at least one active SIM card for personal
  use. Mobile cellular phones supplied by employers that can be used for
  personal reasons (to make personal calls, access the Internet, etc.) are
  included. Individuals who have only active SIM card(s) and not a mobile phone
  device are excluded. Individuals who have a mobile phone for personal use that
  is not registered under his/her name are also included. An active SIM card is
  a SIM card that has been used in the last three months. A mobile (cellular)
  telephone refers to a portable telephone subscribing to a public mobile
  telephone service using cellular technology, which provides access to the
  PSTN. This includes analogue and digital cellular systems and technologies
  such as IMT-2000 (3G) and IMT-Advanced. Users of both postpaid subscriptions
  and prepaid accounts are included. Countries can collect data on this
  indicator through national household surveys.

  The 2011 and 2013 supplements directly asked whether individuals use a
  cellular phone or smartphone to access the Internet. The 2015 estimate
  represents those who 1) use a mobile phone, 2) use the Internet from any
  location, and 3) live in a household where someone accesses a mobile Internet
  service or data plan.

  The 2015 questionnaire asked about Internet and device use during the past 6
  months. Earlier questionnaires did not specify a reference period.
