  This indicator is defined as the 'proportion of individuals who own a mobile
  telephone, by sex'. An individual owns a mobile cellular phone if he/she has a
  mobile cellular phone device with at least one active SIM card for personal
  use. Mobile cellular phones supplied by employers that can be used for
  personal reasons (to make personal calls, access the Internet, etc.) are
  included. Individuals who have only active SIM card(s) and not a mobile phone
  device are excluded. Individuals who have a mobile phone for personal use that
  is not registered under his/her name are also included. An active SIM card is
  a SIM card that has been used in the last three months. A mobile (cellular)
  telephone refers to a portable telephone subscribing to a public mobile
  telephone service using cellular technology, which provides access to the
  PSTN. This includes analogue and digital cellular systems and technologies
  such as IMT-2000 (3G) and IMT-Advanced. Users of both postpaid subscriptions
  and prepaid accounts are included. Countries can collect data on this
  indicator through national household surveys.
