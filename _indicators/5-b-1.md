indicator_definition: This indicator is defined as the 'proportion of individuals
  who own a mobile telephone, by sex'. An individual owns a mobile cellular phone
  if he/she has a mobile cellular phone device with at least one active SIM card for
  personal use. Mobile cellular phones supplied by employers that can be used for
  personal reasons (to make personal calls, access the Internet, etc.) are included.
  Individuals who have only active SIM card(s) and not a mobile phone device are excluded.
  Individuals who have a mobile phone for personal use that is not registered under
  his/her name are also included. An active SIM card is a SIM card that has been used
  in the last three months. A mobile (cellular) telephone refers to a portable telephone
  subscribing to a public mobile telephone service using cellular technology, which
  provides access to the PSTN. This includes analogue and digital cellular systems
  and technologies such as IMT-2000 (3G) and IMT-Advanced. Users of both postpaid
  subscriptions and prepaid accounts are included. Countries can collect data on this
  indicator through national household surveys.
