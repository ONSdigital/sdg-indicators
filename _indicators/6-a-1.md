rationale_interpretation: "Target 6.a includes many elements. The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) is a quantifiable measurement as a proxy for \"international cooperation and capacity development support\" in financial terms, because this data are readily available from the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \nIt is essential to be able to assess ODA in proportion with information about the government coordinated spending plan in proportion of ODA to gain a better understanding of how much countries depend/rely on ODA and highlighting countries total water and sanitation budgets over time."

indicator_name: 'Amount of water- and sanitation-related official development assistance that is part of a government-coordinated spending plan'
target: 'By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacitybuilding support to developing countries in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies.'
indicator_definition: 'International cooperation and capacity-building support implies aid (most of it quantifiable) in the form of grants or loans by external support agencies. The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) can be used as a proxy for this, captured by the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Realising that the role of ODA in international cooperation is evolving and that a broad range of stakeholders is involved in "international cooperation and capacity development support", it is envisaged that this indicator will evolve and will be further qualified during the SDG period. UN-Water is working together with OECD to align the proposed indicator and methodology with OECD work. Official Development Assistance (ODA) is defined as flows of official financing administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective, and which are concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25 per cent (using a fixed 10 per cent rate of discount). By convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries ("bilateral ODA") and to multilateral institutions. ODA receipts comprise disbursements by bilateral donors and multilateral institutions. Lending by export credit agencies''with the pure purpose of export promotion''is excluded (OECD source IMF 2003). A government coordinated spending plan is defined as a financing plan/budget for the water and sanitation sector, clearly assessing the available sources of finance and strategies for financing future needs.'
