indicator_name: Amount of water- and sanitation-related official development assistance
  that is part of a government-coordinated spending plan
target: By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacitybuilding support to
  developing countries in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes,
  including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment,
  recycling and reuse technologies.
indicator_definition: International cooperation and capacity-building support implies
  aid (most of it quantifiable) in the form of grants or loans by external support
  agencies. The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance
  (ODA) can be used as a proxy for this, captured by the Creditor Reporting System
  (CRS) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Realising
  that the role of ODA in international cooperation is evolving and that a broad range
  of stakeholders is involved in "international cooperation and capacity development
  support", it is envisaged that this indicator will evolve and will be further qualified
  during the SDG period. UN-Water is working together with OECD to align the proposed
  indicator and methodology with OECD work. Official Development Assistance (ODA)
  is defined as flows of official financing administered with the promotion of the
  economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective,
  and which are concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25 per
  cent (using a fixed 10 per cent rate of discount). By convention, ODA flows comprise
  contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries
  ("bilateral ODA") and to multilateral institutions. ODA receipts comprise disbursements
  by bilateral donors and multilateral institutions. Lending by export credit agencies'with
  the pure purpose of export promotion'is excluded (OECD source IMF 2003). A government
  coordinated spending plan is defined as a financing plan/budget for the water and
  sanitation sector, clearly assessing the available sources of finance and strategies
  for financing future needs.
