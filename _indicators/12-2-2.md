indicator_name: Domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita,
  and domestic material consumption per GDP
target: By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources
indicator_definition: Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow
  accounting (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent consumption of materials in
  a national economy. It is calculated as direct imports (IM) of material plus domestic
  extraction (DE) of materials minus direct exports (EX) of materials measured in
  metric tonnes. DMC measures the amount of materials that are used in economic processes.
  It does not include materials that are mobilized the process of domestic extraction
  but do not enter the economic process. DMC is based on official economic statistics
  and it requires some modelling to adapt the source data to the methodological requirements
  of the MFA. The accounting standard and accounting methods are set out in the EUROSTAT
  guidebooks for MFA accounts in the latest edition of 2013. MFA accounting is also
  part of the central framework of the System of integrated EnvironmentalEconomic
  Accounts (SEEA).
