  By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality
  primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning
  outcomes.
indicator_definition: >-
  Percentage of children and young people at the end of primary and lower
  secondary levels of education achieving at least a minimum proficiency level
  in (a) reading and (b) mathematics. The minimum proficiency level will be
  measured relative to new common reading and numeracy scales currently in
  development. The indicator is calculated as the number of children and young
  people at the end of primary or lower secondary education achieving or
  exceeding the minimum proficiency level in the given subject, expressed as a
  percentage of all children and young people at the end of primary or lower
  secondary education.

  The main NAEP reports current information for the nation and specific
  geographic regions of the country. The assessment program includes students
  drawn from a sample from both public and private schools and reports results
  for student achievement at grades 4, 8, and 12. The main NAEP assessments
  follow the frameworks developed by the National Assessment Governing Board and
  use the latest advances in assessment methodology. Because the assessment
  items reflect curricula associated with specific grade levels, the main NAEP
  uses samples of students at those grade levels.
