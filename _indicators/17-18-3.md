  We define national statistical program as the suite of Federal statistical
  programs described in the Office of Management and Budget's Annual Report to
  Congress on U.S. Federal Statistical Programs. The report describes funding
  and implementation status by program. A subset of this same infomration is
  provided Analytical Perspectives, a companion document to the President's
  Budget to Congress.
comments_and_limitations: >-
  Programs are fully funded and fully implemented to the extent described in the
  Annual Report. Budget limitations can require Federal programs to reduce the
  scope and/or volume of initially proposed statistical products.
