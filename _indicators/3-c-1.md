  Data are derived from several data sources. Physician information is from the
  American Medical Association Physician Master file. Physician assistant,
  advanced practice registered nurse, nurse practitioner,clinical nurse
  specialist,certified registered nurse anesthetists, and advance practice nurse
  midwife data are from the Centers from Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
  National Provider Identification (NPI) File. The Administrative Simplification
  provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
  (HIPAA) mandated the adoption of standard unique identifiers for health care
  providers and health plans. The NPI is a unique identifier developed by CMS.
  Covered health care providers and all health plans and health care
  clearinghouses must use the NPIs in the administrative and financial
  transactions adopted under HIPAA. 2010 Population information is from 2010
  Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File, U.S. Census Bureau
  and 2011-2014 Population Estimates are from the Bureau of the Census and
  include the calculated number of people living in an area as of July 1. The
  estimated population is calculated from a components of change model that
  incorporates information on natural change (births, deaths) and net migration
  (net internal migration, net international migration) that has occurred in an
  area since a Census 2000 reference date for 2001-2009 estimates and Census
  2010 for 2011-2014 estimates. 2013 metro/non-metro information is from the
  U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s Economic Research Service (ERS) website:
