  The further from 1 the parity index lies, the greater the disparity between
  the two groups of interest (but see the comments and limitations section for
  further information).

target: >-
  By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to
  all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including
  persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable
  situations.
indicator_definition: >-
  Parity indices require no additional data than the specific disaggregations of
  interest. They are simply the ratio of the indicator value for one group to
  that of the other. Typically, the likely more disadvantaged group is the
  numerator. A value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups.

  provided under other indicator metadata. Raw data are provided since there it
  would seem to be inappropriate to have some groups in the numerator on some
  metrics and in the denominator on others.

  Refer to metadata for specific indicators. Note that parity measures suggested
  above are highly sensitive to small differences and do not account for
  differences strictly due to standard errors of the samples. The problem with
  the suggested metric is compounded when comparing relatively small
  percentages. So, if 10 percent of males and 12 percent of females were
  enrolled at a particular level, and there was a standard error of .75 on each
  metric, there would be no significant difference yet the parity ratio as
  specified above would be .83 which might suggest a substantial difference. The
  two point difference flipping the perspective to 88 and 90 percent enrolled
  would yield a metric of 98, which would be more in line with the
  non-significant difference. As a result of these concerns with the specified
  metrics and the nonlinear aspect of the metric, we strongly recommend a
  different approach be used to compare across countries when the differences
  from country to country in the raw metrics may be assumed to be very large.
