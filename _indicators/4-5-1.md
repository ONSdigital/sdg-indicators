indicator_name: Parity indices (female/male, rural/urban, bottom/top wealth quintile
  and others such as disability status, indigenous peoples and conflict-affected,
  as data become available) for all education indicators on this list that can be
  disaggregated
target: By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access
  to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including
  persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations.
indicator_definition: Parity indices require no additional data than the specific
  disaggregations of interest. They are simply the ratio of the indicator value for
  one group to that of the other. Typically, the likely more disadvantaged group is
  the numerator. A value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups.
graph_title: National statistics are not graphed. Ratios are not provided, but can
  be calculated at the user's discretion. See comments and limitations, below.
