indicator_name: Number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory
  and/or policy guarantees for public access to information
target: Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance
  with national legislation and international agreements.
indicator_definition: "For this indicator, the operative words are \"existence\" and
  \"implementation\". As such, it establishes: (a) whether a country (or at the global
  level, the number of countries) has constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees
  for public access to information; (b) the extent to which such national guarantees
  reflect 'international agreements' (e.g. Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
  etc.); and (c) the implementation mechanisms in place for such guarantees, including
  the following variables: \tGovernment efforts to publicly promote the right to information.
  \tCitizens' awareness of their legal right to information and their ability to utilise
  it effectively. \tThe capacity of public bodies to provide information upon request
  by the public. This indicator will thus collate data from multiple sources, including
  National Human Rights Institutions, national and international non-governmental
  organisations, academic institutions, and national media regulatory authorities,
  among others. Such information will be gathered, processed and checked by international
  organisations - UNESCO and World Bank. UNESCO collects some aspects of this data
  using the Media Development Indicators, in addition to the biennial World Trends
  in Freedom of Expression and Media Development report. Data are available for at
  least 195 countries."
