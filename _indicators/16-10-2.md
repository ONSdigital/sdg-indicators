rationale_interpretation: "The definition here relates directly to \"public access to information\", which is wider than, but is also very much based upon, the established fundamental freedoms of expression and association. \n(Conversely, these freedoms also both impact on the environment for public access to information). \nThe focus of this indicator is thus on the status of adoption and implementation of constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information. \nAs suggested by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and UNESCO in earlier presentations to the UN Technical Support Team (UN TST), this is a relevant and measurable indicator. \nIt also responds to the growing number of UN member states that have already adopted legal guarantees, and many others that are currently considering relevant legislation or regulation in the field. \nThe rationale for assessing the implementation dimension is to assess the relevance of legal steps to practical information accessibility. It is not a composite indicator, but a logical linkage of laws and policies to practical impact that is relevant to SDG concerns. \nThe practical guarantee of public access may be partially assessed through dimensions such as those unpacked by The World Bank. In this way, the practical quality of legal provisions can be established by identifying if there are: 1) proactive disclosure provisions in laws that establish a legal duty to disclose; 2) mechanisms for citizens, firms, and others to request information that has not been proactively disclosed but that is relevant to their interests, 3) narrowly-tailored guidelines on exemptions to disclosure, and 4) institutional structures that support disclosure, such as information commissioners, oversight mechanisms, and complaints mechanisms. In some national cases, there is also information on the sources and numbers of requests and the response time taken to process these requests. \nUNESCO, within its mandate for the right to freedom of expression, which includes the corollary of the right to freedom of information, already monitors progress and issues in this area through its existing submissions to the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and regularly issued research reports on World Trends on Freedom of Expression and Media Development, including its Media Development Indicators assessments. Collaboration with the World Bank is foreseen, as well as drawing upon work undertaken by ARTICLE 19 in this area. \nAll these will be considered important aspects of establishing the existence and implementation of constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information."

indicator_name: 'Number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information'
target: 'Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements.'
indicator_definition: "For this indicator, the operative words are \"existence\" and \"implementation\". As such, it establishes: (a) whether a country (or at the global level, the number of countries) has constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information; (b) the extent to which such national guarantees reflect 'international agreements' (e.g. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, etc.); and (c) the implementation mechanisms in place for such guarantees, including the following variables: \tGovernment efforts to publicly promote the right to information. \tCitizens' awareness of their legal right to information and their ability to utilise it effectively. \tThe capacity of public bodies to provide information upon request by the public. This indicator will thus collate data from multiple sources, including National Human Rights Institutions, national and international non-governmental organisations, academic institutions, and national media regulatory authorities, among others. Such information will be gathered, processed and checked by international organisations - UNESCO and World Bank. UNESCO collects some aspects of this data using the Media Development Indicators, in addition to the biennial World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development report. Data are available for at least 195 countries."
