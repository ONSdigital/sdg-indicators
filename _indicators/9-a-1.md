  Figures may not sum to totals due to roundings. In the CRS (Creditor Reporting
  System), data on the sector of destination are recorded using 5-digit purpose
  codes.  The first three digits of the code refer to the corresponding DAC5
  sector or category.  Each CRS code belongs to one and only one DAC5 category. 
  Generally, the last two digits of the CRS purpose code are sequential and not
  hierarchical i.e., each CRS code stands for itself and can be selected
  individually or grouped to create sub-sectors. The Governance and civil
  society, general sector is an exception where purpose codes are hierarchically
  structured.   It is not possible to track directly the destination or purpose
  of UK funding to the general core budgets of the multilateral organisations.
  However a good indication of where UK funding goes is provided by OECD DAC
  data where the multilaterals report aid spend by country and sector. Therefore
  the multilateral data are estimates which have been calculated on the basis of
  the UK's share of the multilaterals' reported aid spending to the OECD.  The
  OECD data cover most of the main multilaterals the UK funds.  About 15% of the
  UK's core multilateral funding is not covered by the OECD data, and this
  unreported spending is allocated to the developing countries unspecified
  category.   More details on the estimates' quality are found in the Imputed
  multilateral share quality report (Statistics on International Development
  2016).
