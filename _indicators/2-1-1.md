indicator_name: Prevalence of undernourishment
target: By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor
  and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and
  sufficient food all year round.
indicator_definition: 'The Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) is defined as the
  probability that a randomly selected individual from the reference population is
  found to consume less than his/her calorie requirement for an active and healthy
  life. It is written as: ______ = '' __(__)____ __<________ where f(x) is the probability
  density function of per capita calorie consumption and MDER is a Minimum Dietary
  Energy Requirement. The MDER threshold is computed on the basis of normative energy
  requirement standards referred to a minimum level of physical activity. Estimates
  of the number of undernourished (NoU) - calculated by multiplying the PoU by the
  size of the reference population - are used to monitor progress towards the World
  Food Summit goal of reducing by half the number of people suffering from undernourishment.
  The parameters needed for the calculation of the indicator are: the mean level of
  dietary energy consumption (DEC); a cut-off point defined as the Minimum Dietary
  Energy Requirement (MDER); the coefficient of variation (CV) as a parameter accounting
  for inequality in food consumption; and a skewedness (SK) parameter accounting for
  asymmetry in the distribution. The DEC as well as the MDER are updated annually,
  with the former calculated from the FAO Food Balance Sheets. The MDER is calculated
  as a weighted average of energy requirements according to sex and age class, and
  is updated each year from UN population ratio data. The inequality in food consumption
  parameters are derived from National Household Survey data when such data is available
  and reliable. Due to the limited number of available household surveys, the inequality
  in food access parameters are updated much less frequently over time than the DEC
  and MDER parameters.'
