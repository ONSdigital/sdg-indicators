indicator_name: Prevalence of undernourishment
target: By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor
  and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and
  sufficient food all year round
indicator_definition: "The Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) is defined as the\
  \ probability that a randomly selected individual from the reference population\
  \ is found to consume less than his/her calorie requirement for an active and healthy\
  \ life. It is written as: ______ = ' __(__)____ __<________ where f(x) is the probability\
  \ density function of per capita calorie consumption and MDER is a Minimum Dietary\
  \ Energy Requirement. The MDER threshold is computed on the basis of normative energy\
  \ requirement standards referred to a minimum level of physical activity. Estimates\
  \ of the number of undernourished (NoU) - calculated by multiplying the PoU by the\
  \ size of the reference population - are used to monitor progress towards the World\
  \ Food Summit goal of reducing by half the number of people suffering from undernourishment.\
  \ The parameters needed for the calculation of the indicator are: the mean level\
  \ of dietary energy consumption (DEC); a cut-off point defined as the Minimum Dietary\
  \ Energy Requirement (MDER); the coefficient of variation (CV) as a parameter accounting\
  \ for inequality in food consumption; and a skewedness (SK) parameter accounting\
  \ for asymmetry in the distribution. The DEC as well as the MDER are updated annually,\
  \ with the former calculated from the FAO Food Balance Sheets. The MDER is calculated\
  \ as a weighted average of energy requirements according to sex and age class, and\
  \ is updated each year from UN population ratio data. The inequality in food consumption\
  \ parameters are derived from National Household Survey data when such data is available\
  \ and reliable. Due to the limited number of available household surveys, the inequality\
  \ in food access parameters are updated much less frequently over time than the\
  \ DEC and MDER parameters."
