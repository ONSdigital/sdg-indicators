  Measures of tax burden are indicators of how well tax policy meets one of its
  primary goals, equitably raising the revenues needed to run government. Equity
  has two aspects. The first, vertical equity, concerns the way taxes are
  distributed among taxpayers with different abilities to pay. The second,
  horizontal equity, concerns the way taxes are distributed among taxpayers with
  the same ability to pay. Tax burden measures thus answer broad economic and
  social questions about the effect of tax policy on the distribution of income
  and wealth. 

  The distinction regarding national, state and/or local level government is
  important. For the purposes of monitoring this indicator, the central budget
  is seen as the focus (even if some of tax payments go to other jurisdictions).
  When decisions about resources are made, the budgetary central government is a
  key subsector of the general government sector of the economy. The general
  government sector consists of resident institutional units that fulfill the
  functions of government as their primary activity. In all countries, there is
  an institutional unit of the general government sector particularly important
  in terms of size and power, in particular the power to exercise control over
  many other units and entities. The budgetary central government is often a
  single unit of the central government that encompasses the fundamental
  activities of the national executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. This
  component of general government is usually covered by the main (or general)
  budget. The budgetary central government's revenue and expense are normally
  regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional
  equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the legislature. Most of the
  ministries, departments, agencies, boards, commissions, judicial authorities,
  legislative bodies, and other entities that make up the budgetary central
  government are not separate institutional units. This is because they
  generally do not have the authority to own assets, incur liabilities, or
  engage in transactions in their own right (see GFSM 2014 Chapter 2). 

  There is a widespread acceptance ' in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and indeed
  in Agenda 2030 ' that multiple sources of finance will be needed to meet the
  SDGs, and that these will need to work together effectively. This includes a
  greater role for domestic resources in meeting national development goals, and
  for interventions in which public resources ' including ODA - strengthen
  domestic capacities for expanding their revenue bases. Indeed, especially in
  developing countries, vertical fiscal gaps will potentially widen as demands
  increase for higher public spending ' particularly in countries where there is
  significant pressure on central authorities to provide quality infrastructure
  and basic services. In many cases the execution of the budgetary central
  government's proposed budget is constrained by poor revenue administration
  and/or a lack of a statistical framework for monitoring revenue streams. Given
  unpredictable and fluctuating levels of revenue in many developing countries,
  improved revenue statistics will help mitigate any possible budget shortfalls
  and support the sustainable development of national economies.

target: >-
  Strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international
  support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax and
  other revenue collection.
indicator_definition: >-
  Tax burden: Revenue in the form of taxes as defined under government finance
  statistics (GFS) code 11 as a share of total revenue. In GFS, taxes are
  classified into six major categories: (i) taxes on income, profits, and
  capital gains; (ii) taxes on payroll and workforce; (iii) taxes on property;
  (iv) taxes on goods and services; (v) taxes on international trade and
  transactions; and (vi) other taxes. (Source: IMF, Government Finance
  Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014), Table 4A.1, assessed Dec 28 2015) Concepts
  Tax burden concept may be disaggregated into the complementary concepts of:
  "direct taxes" or taxes that take into account individual circumstances of
  taxpayers (e.g., taxes on individual and corporate income), which can be
  calculated from the following detailed GFS revenue classifications: 111 Taxes
  on income, profits, and capital gains+1131 Recurrent taxes on immovable
  property+1132 Recurrent taxes on net wealth+1136 Other recurrent taxes on
  property; and "indirect taxes" or taxes that do not take into account
  individual circumstances of taxpayers (e.g., taxes imposed on goods and
  services), which can be calculated from the following detailed GFS revenue
  classifications 112 Taxes on payroll and workforce+114 Taxes on goods and
  services+115 Taxes on international trade and transactions+116 Other taxes.
  Tax burden is directly related to the wider concept of fiscal burden, which
  can be derived from combining two GFSM 2014 revenue codes: code 11 Taxes plus
  code 12, Social Contributions or, alternatively 11+121+122. These concepts can
  also be found in the 2008 System of National Accounts (2008 SNA). The
  coverage, timing, and valuation of tax revenue in GFSM 2014 and the 2008 SNA
  are identical, but the classification systems differ. The 2008 SNA classifies
  taxes according to their role in economic activities'namely: (i) taxes on
  production and imports (D2); (ii) current taxes on income, wealth, etc. (D5);
  and (iii) capital taxes (D91). The result is that some categories of taxes in
  GFS need to be allocated between two of the SNA tax categories according to
  whether they are payable by producers or final consumers, or whether they are
  current or capital taxes. A detailed description of the linkages between the
  GFS and the 2008 SNA categories of taxes is provided in Appendix 7 of the GFSM
  2014.
