indicator_name: Proportion of domestic budget funded by domestic taxes
target: Strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international
  support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax and other
  revenue collection.
indicator_definition: 'Tax burden: Revenue in the form of taxes as defined under government
  finance statistics (GFS) code 11 as a share of total revenue. In GFS, taxes are
  classified into six major categories: (i) taxes on income, profits, and capital
  gains; (ii) taxes on payroll and workforce; (iii) taxes on property; (iv) taxes
  on goods and services; (v) taxes on international trade and transactions; and (vi)
  other taxes. (Source: IMF, Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014),
  Table 4A.1, assessed Dec 28 2015) Concepts Tax burden concept may be disaggregated
  into the complementary concepts of: "direct taxes" or taxes that take into account
  individual circumstances of taxpayers (e.g., taxes on individual and corporate income),
  which can be calculated from the following detailed GFS revenue classifications:
  111 Taxes on income, profits, and capital gains+1131 Recurrent taxes on immovable
  property+1132 Recurrent taxes on net wealth+1136 Other recurrent taxes on property;
  and "indirect taxes" or taxes that do not take into account individual circumstances
  of taxpayers (e.g., taxes imposed on goods and services), which can be calculated
  from the following detailed GFS revenue classifications 112 Taxes on payroll and
  workforce+114 Taxes on goods and services+115 Taxes on international trade and transactions+116
  Other taxes. Tax burden is directly related to the wider concept of fiscal burden,
  which can be derived from combining two GFSM 2014 revenue codes: code 11 Taxes plus
  code 12, Social Contributions or, alternatively 11+121+122. These concepts can also
  be found in the 2008 System of National Accounts (2008 SNA). The coverage, timing,
  and valuation of tax revenue in GFSM 2014 and the 2008 SNA are identical, but the
  classification systems differ. The 2008 SNA classifies taxes according to their
  role in economic activities''namely: (i) taxes on production and imports (D2); (ii)
  current taxes on income, wealth, etc. (D5); and (iii) capital taxes (D91). The result
  is that some categories of taxes in GFS need to be allocated between two of the
  SNA tax categories according to whether they are payable by producers or final consumers,
  or whether they are current or capital taxes. A detailed description of the linkages
  between the GFS and the 2008 SNA categories of taxes is provided in Appendix 7 of
  the GFSM 2014.'
