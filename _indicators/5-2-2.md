  sexual violence by persons other than an intimate partner in the previous 12 months,

indicator_definition: "Number of girls and women aged 15+ who were subjected to sexual
  violence by persons other than an intimate partner, as percentage of all girls and
  women aged 15+, disaggregated by age and place of occurrence. Sexual violence as
  defined in para 60 of the UN Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against
  Women: Statistical Surveys [1]: ... is any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behavior
  that is imposed on someone. It includes act of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement
  in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts with a woman without her consent,
  sexual harassment, verbal abuse, threats, exposure, unwanted touching, incest, etc.
  A minimum list of acts of sexual violence, which should be expanded depending on
  the specific country context, consists of the following: (a) Rape: Refers to engaging
  in the non-consensual vaginal, anal, or oral penetration of a sexual nature of the
  body of another person with any bodily part or object, including through the use
  of physical violence and by putting the victim in a situation where she cannot say
  no or complies because of fear; (b) Attempted rape: Refers to attempting to have
  non-consensual sexual intercourse through the use of force or threats; (c) Other
  sexual acts: Refers to: \tIntimate touching without consent \tSexual acts other
  than intercourse forced by money \tSexual acts other than intercourse obtained through
  threats of physical violence \tSexual acts other than intercourse obtained through
  threats to the well-being of family members \tUse of force or coercion to obtain
  unwanted sexual acts or any sexual activity that the female partner finds degrading
  or humiliating \tOther acts of sexual violence. The indicator specifically considers
  the following: 1) sexual violence (separately from physical violence); 2) women
  and girls aged 15+ who were subjected to sexual violence; and 3) by perpetrators
  who are persons other than an intimate partner.  This indicator provides the proportion
  of ever-partnered girls and women aged 15+ subjected to physical, sexual or psychological
  violence in the last 12 months by a current or former intimate partner. It is calculated
  by dividing the number of ever-partnered girls and women aged 15+ subjected to physical,
  sexual or psychological in the last 12 months by a current or former intimate partner
  by the total number of ever-partnered girls and women aged 15+ in the population."
