indicator_definition: "Number of girls and women aged 15+ who were subjected to sexual violence by persons other than an intimate partner, as percentage of all girls and women aged 15+, disaggregated by age and place of occurrence. Sexual violence as defined in para 60 of the UN Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women: Statistical Surveys [1]: ... is any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behavior that is imposed on someone. It includes act of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts with a woman without her consent, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, threats, exposure, unwanted touching, incest, etc. A minimum list of acts of sexual violence, which should be expanded depending on the specific country context, consists of the following: (a) Rape: Refers to engaging in the non-consensual vaginal, anal, or oral penetration of a sexual nature of the body of another person with any bodily part or object, including through the use of physical violence and by putting the victim in a situation where she cannot say no or complies because of fear; (b) Attempted rape: Refers to attempting to have non-consensual sexual intercourse through the use of force or threats; (c) Other sexual acts: Refers to: \tIntimate touching without consent \tSexual acts other than intercourse forced by money \tSexual acts other than intercourse obtained through threats of physical violence \tSexual acts other than intercourse obtained through threats to the well-being of family members \tUse of force or coercion to obtain unwanted sexual acts or any sexual activity that the female partner finds degrading or humiliating \tOther acts of sexual violence. The indicator specifically considers the following: 1) sexual violence (separately from physical violence); 2) women and girls aged 15+ who were subjected to sexual violence; and 3) by perpetrators who are persons other than an intimate partner.  This indicator provides the proportion of ever-partnered girls and women aged 15+ subjected to physical, sexual or psychological violence in the last 12 months by a current or former intimate partner. It is calculated by dividing the number of ever-partnered girls and women aged 15+ subjected to physical, sexual or psychological in the last 12 months by a current or former intimate partner by the total number of ever-partnered girls and women aged 15+ in the population."
