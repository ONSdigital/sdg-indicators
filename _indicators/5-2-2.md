  According to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women
  (1993), Violence against Women is “Any act of gender-based violence that
  results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm
  or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary
  deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.
  Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited
  to, the following: Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in
  the family […]”. See here for full definition:
  http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm Intimate partner violence
  includes any abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner within the
  context of marriage, cohabitation or any other formal or informal union. The
  different forms of violence included in the indicator are defined as follows:
  1. Physical violence consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim
  and include, but are not limited to, pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm,
  pulling the hair, slapping, kicking, biting or hitting with the fist or
  object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose, or
  threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife. 2. Sexual
  violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that
  is imposed on someone. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced
  engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent,
  incest, sexual harassment, etc. In intimate partner relationships,
  experiencing sexual violence is commonly defined as being forced to have
  sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner
  might do, and/or being forced to so something sexual that the woman considers
  humiliating or degrading. 3. Psychological violence includes a range of
  behaviours that encompass acts of emotional abuse and controlling behaviour.
  These often coexist with acts of physical and sexual violence by intimate
  partners and are acts of violence in themselves. For a more detailed
  definition of physical, sexual and psychological violence against women see
  Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical
  Surveys (UN, 2014).
computation_calculations: >-
  The theory underpinning this calculation: taking the total number of adults
  aged 16 to 59 in England and Wales who experienced any domestic abuse in the
  past 12 months and divided this by the total number of adults with the same
  age category in England/Wales and multiplied by 100.
computation_disaggregation: >-

  least deprived output areas). These disaggregation can be further
  disaggregated amongst each other (e.g. sexual assault category by sex).
comments_limitations: >-
  Presently the only ages covered are between 16 and 59 but the upper bound of
  this is likely to increase over time. The original figures refer to data that
  runs from April of that year to March the following year. For example 2015
  data date range is from April 2015 to March 2016. These data relate to women
  aged 16 and over (as opposed to 15 and over). The headline data are published
  in July; however the specific breakdowns (disaggregation’s, i.e. age, etc) are
  published in February. Coverage is limited to England and Wales. The indicator
  includes all domestic abuse (including partner abuse), abuse by a family
  member, sexual assault and stalking. Where disaggregation occurs, partner
  abuse is omitted, where there is overall data, partner abuse is included.
