  It is important to note that national minimum training requirements can vary
  widely from one country to the next. This variability between countries
  lessens the usefulness of global tracking because the indicator would only
  show the percent reaching national standards, not whether teachers in
  different countries have similar levels of training. Further work would be
  required if a common standard for teacher training is to be applied across
  countries.
