title: >-
  Proportion of teachers in: (a) pre-primary; (b) primary; (c) lower secondary; and (d) upper secondary education who have received at least the minimum organized teacher training (e.g. pedagogical training) pre-service or in-service required for teaching at the relevant level in a given country
target_id: '4.c'

  By 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing States

computation_units: Proportion of teachers
computation_definitions: >-
  A teacher is trained if they have received at least the minimum organized pedagogical teacher training pre-service and in-service required for teaching at the relevant level in a given country.
computation_calculations: >-
  The number of teachers in a given level of education who are trained is expressed as a percentage of all teachers in that level of education.




computation_disaggregation: Sex, Teaching Level and Qualified teachers

comments_limitations: >-
  It is important to note that national minimum training requirements can vary widely from one country to the next. This variability between countries lessens the usefulness of global tracking because the indicator would only show the percent reaching national standards, not whether teachers in different countries have similar levels of training. Further work would be required if a common standard for teacher training is to be applied across countries.
