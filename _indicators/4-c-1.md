target: By 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including
  through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries,
  especially least developed countries and small island developing States

comments_limitations: It is important to note that national minimum training requirements
  can vary widely from one country to the next. This variability between countries
  lessens the usefulness of global tracking because the indicator would only show
  the percent reaching national standards, not whether teachers in different countries
  have similar levels of training. Further work would be required if a common standard
  for teacher training is to be applied across countries.
