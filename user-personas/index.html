        <h1>User Personas</h1>
        <p>We want to provide a data site that is easy to use by everybody and has purpose. To achieve this, we want to understand more about who uses the site and what they need from the site.
This year we have started to research who uses the data site and for which reasons. So far, over 50 people from a variety of organisations have taken part. The research involved interviewing people face-to-face or by telephone. We spoke to people across government, from academia and the private sector.
We have also carried out some usability testing, too. We tasked people to use the site to find specific information. Then we asked them about their experience. This information has informed our decisions about how we develop the data site.</p>

<p>Our research has not ended. We will continue our user research and our usability testing for the lifetime of the data site.</p>

<p>As this was an initial phase of user research with a small number of participants, we will carry out further research to validate the user types. Further research will be carried out with custodian agencies, concerned citizens, government SDG policy analysts, local authorities and master builders as well as other users.</p>

<p>If you have any further questions about the user personas or our user research, or if you want to be involved with future user research, please contact us at <i class="fa fa-envelope"></i> <a href="mailto:SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk">SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, please complete our <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/XFJZGVL">short survey</a> to give some feedback about the site.</p>

<h3 id="what-did-we-find">What did we find?</h3>

<p>We identified four main user types or personas:</p>

<p><img src="https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/public/blog/user_personas.png" alt="Diagram showing summary of user personas on scale of data type needed from visual data to raw data in the following order: concerned citizen, connected influencer, fact gatherer, involved analyst." height="300px" /></p>

</ul>

<h4 id="behaviours-and-preferences">Behaviours and preferences</h4>
