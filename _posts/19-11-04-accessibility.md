The commitment to “leave no one behind” is central to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It extends to making our digital content accessible and functional for all users regardless of any disability or physical impairment.

We have labelled the site according to the generally accepted phases of site development:

Alpha: 

Beta: 

Live: 

The data site where this update is hosted is still in a testing phase, so we are using the ‘alpha’ label. We want to move the site to the next phase known as ‘beta’. We needed the site to reach the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) ‘AA’ standard before we can label it as beta. This is a universally-recognised standard, designed to guarantee that assessed websites reach the predetermined accessibility criteria. 

We updated some of the site’s features before it was tested, including:

*	making data tables and menus keyboard compatible
*	improving the high-contrast feature
*	adding descriptive labels and alternative text

We tested the improvements on a range of desktop and mobile devices using a variety of browsers and screen-readers.
The Digital Accessibility Centre tested the data site against the WCAG ‘AA’ standard in July 2019. The newly-accessible site was re-tested in July 2019 and passed, receiving ‘AA’ certification.

With ‘AA’ standard achieved, the UK SDG data site is now considered accessible to all users. A new code release (0.8.0) included these accessibility updates on the shared code repository ‘Open SDG’. This means that any country is able to use these updates.
