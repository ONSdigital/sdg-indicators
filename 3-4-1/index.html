Estimation of cause-of-death distributions. 3. Calculation of age-specific mortality rates from the four main NCDs for each five-year age range between 30 and 70. 4. Calculation of the probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases.

            Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease. The probability of death between two ages may be called a mortality rate. This is the likelihood that an individual would die between two ages given current mortality rates at each age, calculated using life table methods. Probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases, defined as the per cent of 30-year-old-people who would die before their 70th birthday from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease, assuming that s/he would experience current mortality rates at every age and s/he would not die from any other cause of death.
